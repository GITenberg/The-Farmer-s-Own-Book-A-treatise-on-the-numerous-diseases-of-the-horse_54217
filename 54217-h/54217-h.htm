<h2>PREFACE.</h2>

<p>The object of this work is to give a thorough explanation of
the numerous diseases to which the horse is subject, and point
out in a clear and distinct manner the symptoms by which the
diseases may be known, so that the Farmer and others having
the care of horses may be enabled to detect any disease in its
first stages,&mdash;thereby rendering it an easy case to cure; also,
giving a regular course of medicine to be pursued in the treatment
of the different diseases, by which almost any one, with a little
study, can treat the most difficult cases. The great objection to
other works that have been issued is that they do not point out
the symptoms of the diseases in horses; and their treatment is
so badly arranged that it is very difficult for the Farmer and
persons generally to understand it. The advantages this work
possesses over others, is its plainness in pointing out the difficulties
attending the treatment of diseases in horses and the
manner in which they may be surmounted. And it is hoped
that those interested will give this book their careful attention,
as the author is satisfied that it will save them a vast amount
of time and trouble in times of need.</p>

<h2>DISEASES OF HORSES.</h2>

<p>The diseases of the horse are very numerous,
and many of them so complicated as to defy detection,
except by those who are thoroughly acquainted
with the nature of the animal, and his
mode of living. This is the reason that horses
which have been under the care of the farrier
are often returned to the owner in a worse condition
than when they received them. It is to
prevent this practice as much as possible that
has induced me to bring this work before the
public, in the hope of alleviating the condition
of that noble animal&mdash;<em>the Horse</em>.</p>

<h3>THE POLL EVIL.</h3>

<p>This disease may arise from accident, but is
commonly the result of blows or bruises carelessly
inflicted by those having charge of the
horses. It is a tumor or swelling in the sinews,
found between the noll bone and the uppermost
joint of the neck, immediately on the nap of
the neck.</p>

<p>Nearly all farriers, tell you to sell your horse
for anything he will bring, or give him away;
but I would advise you to keep your horse and
cure him, which can be done quickly and surely
with the following remedies:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span></p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Remedy No. 1.</span></h4>

<p>First wash the sore well with strong warm soap
suds, then drop 8 or 10 drops of muriatic acid
in it twice a day, until it has the appearance of
a fresh wound, after which it should be washed
clean with soap suds from castile soap and then
left to heal, which it will quickly do if the acid
has been used long enough in a proper manner;
but if it does not get well, wash as before, and
apply the acid until a cure is effected. It is a
sure remedy, and will not fail if applied properly
until the disease is burnt out or killed.</p>

<p>In case you should drop any of the acid on
the part that is not affected, apply a little oil,
which will neutralize the power of the acid and
prevent it from becoming sore.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Remedy No. 2.</span></h4>

<p>When the disease first makes its appearance,
take a quantity of asmart and put it to soak,
letting it remain all night. In the morning
take as much as you can hold in your hand and
apply it to the swollen part, holding it there
some 20 or 30 minutes, pressing on it as hard as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
you conveniently can, which must be repeated
several times. This remedy generally scatters
the disease, but if it should fail you will be
obliged to use applications of a more astringent
nature.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Remedy No. 3.</span></h4>

<p>After the disease has fully shown itself, wash
as directed in Remedy No. 1; then take Arsenic
and apply it until the foul flesh has all disappeared,
and let it heal. This is a certain remedy,
and has cured several cases within my own
knowledge.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Remedy No. 4.</span></h4>

<p>Take 1 quart of strong ley and boil it into a
salve, then apply a portion of the salve every 2
hours until the core comes out, and heal with
elder ointment. If this remedy does not effect
a cure on the first application, try it again, as
it is a certain cure. Should the ley after being
boiled down leave a hard substance, it must be
worked into a salve.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span></p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Remedy No. 5.</span></h4>

<p>First wash the ulcer well with warm soap
suds; then take air-slacked lime and put as
much into the sore as will lay on, which must
be repeated 2 or 3 times a day, and the affected
part cleaned and swabbed out as often. This,
though very simple, is an excellent remedy,
which I have never known to fail.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The foregoing remedies are very plain and
simple, and cannot fail if properly applied. In
washing the ulcers, use none other than castile
soap, which is far superior to any other for
cleansing and healing wounds and eruptions of
any kind, and can be had from any of the drug
stores at 25 cents per pound. It is also an excellent
article for domestic purposes, such as
shaving, &amp;c. and will be found cheaper than
any other fine or toilet soaps.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span></p>

<h3>FLATULENT OR WIND COLIC.</h3>

<p>This is an entirely different disease from the
Spasmodic Colic. It often originates with something
that the horse has eaten and then drinking
large quantities of water, by which the food
becomes fermented and creates a gastric gas,
which enlarges to a greater or less extent, sometimes
to twenty or thirty times the bulk of the
food. It generally takes place in the stomach,
but at times in the small or large intestines.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Symptoms.</span></h4>

<p>The horse suddenly slacks his pace, perhaps
lays or falls down as if he were shot. In the
stable he paws the floor with his fore feet, lays
down and rolls, starts up instantly and throws
himself down again with greater violence, looks
wistfully at his flanks, and makes many fruitless
efforts to void his urine. Here the symptoms
are similar to other colics, but the true
character of the disease soon develops itself.&mdash;It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
is in one of the large intestines, and the belly
swells all round, but mostly on the right flanks
and as the disease progresses the pain becomes
more intense, and the horse more violent. The
treatment is quite different from other colics.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Remedy No. 1.</span></h4>

<p>Take 1 ounce of the chlorate of lime and ½
pint of warm water, put it into a bottle and
shake well, so as to dissolve, then give it as a
drench which will devour the gas, and cause the
swelling to subside. If in fifteen minutes after
this has been given, the pain does not seem to
have been alleviated, take 4 ounces of spirits of
Pimento, and 1 ounce of Laudanum, mix it with
½ pint of warm water and give it also as a
drench. If you have no pimento and it is not
convenient to get it, take 2½ ounces of peppermint,
and 1 ounce of laudanum, and should you
not have laudanum, take a larger quantity of
peppermint with ½ pint of warm water, and
give it as a drench. In this disease no time
should be lost, as it very often runs its course in
from 1 to 2 hours. If the first should not give<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
relief in 15 or 20 minutes, repeat it until it does.
Rubbing the belly with a smooth rail or pole
will greatly facilitate the action of the medicine.
Should you not have any of the above remedies
on hand or convenient, use from 1 to 2 ounces
of golden tincture as the case may require.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Remedy No. 2.</span></h4>

<p>In the first place take 2 ounces of the essence
of peppermint, mixed with ½ pint of warm
water and give it to him as a drench, then take
a bat of common raw cotton and set fire to it,
holding it close to the nostrils of the horse,
so that he can freely inhale the smoke arising
therefrom; continue this until you see that
the horse is relieved. The quantity of cotton
used is from 4 to 5 bats, as the necessity of the
case may require.</p>

<p>This is a simple and safe remedy, and numbers
who have tried it say that they have never
known it to fail. I saw a horse that had suffered
from the colic for nearly three hours, being
puffed up almost to bursting, and in half an
hour after this operation had been performed on
him, he was completely cured.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span></p>

<h3>SPASMODIC COLIC.</h3>

<p>This is a disease to which horses generally are
subject, and in consequence of improper treatment,
it often proves fatal. It is produced by
improper riding, feeding, watering, and may
arise from a want of proper action in the bowels,
which occasions constriction of the intestines
and a confinement of the air.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Symptoms.</span></h4>

<p>The horse begins to shift his position, looks
around at his flanks, paws violently, strikes his
belly with his feet, and crouches in a peculiar
manner, advancing his hind legs under him, he
then suddenly lies or rather falls down, and
balances himself on his back with his feet resting
on his belly. The pain seems to have ceased
for a while, and he gets up and shakes himself;
he begins to feed, but in a short time the pain
returns, and is more violent than before; he
heaves at the flanks, breaks out in a profused<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
perspiration, and throws himself more recklessly.
The pulse is little affected in the commencement,
but as the disease progresses, it
becomes full. Legs and ears of a natural temperature.
The affection of the strength scarcely
perceivable.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Remedy.</span></h4>

<p>Relief may be obtained from motion in this
disease. Take</p>

<ul>
<li>1 ounce of turpentine,</li>
<li>1 ounce of laudanum,</li>
<li>½ pint of gin or good whiskey,</li>
<li>½ pint of warm water.</li>
</ul>

<p>Mix and give it as a drench. Bleed, and if not
relieved in half an hour, repeat the dose, rubbing
the belly with a stout brush or a smooth
rail. If not relieved in 15 or 20 minutes, repeat
the dose and continue it until relief is obtained.
If the horse be walked about or trotted moderately,
it will relieve the spasms. A glyster
with warm soap suds should be injected, which
may be done by burning the peth out of elder,
and filling a bladder with the suds, then tie the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
bladder on the elder tight and force it into the
fundament, occasionally throwing the warm
suds in until it operates; if a reasonable portion
of it remains, it will do no harm if it does not
operate, but will help to relieve the spasms.
This should be done immediately, as in most
cases no time is to be lost. A glyster of tobacco
smoke may be thrown in as a last resort. Keep
the horse in a warm stable and give bran mash
and plenty of warm or thin gruel for two or
three days.</p>

<p>The turpentine, laudanum, gin and warm
water were never known to fail if given at the
proper time. Should you not have these medicines
at hand, give 2½ or 3 ounces of peppermint
every 15 or 20 minutes until the horse is
relieved; or if you have no peppermint, give
same quantity of golden tincture.</p>

<p>The gruel for feeding is made by putting any
quantity of bran into a bucket or tub, then pour
boiling water over it, so as to scald it thoroughly,
and cover it with a cloth until it is cool
enough for him to eat.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span></p>

<h3>INFLAMMATION OF THE BLADDER.</h3>

<p>In this disease and inflammation of the kidneys,
the symptoms are nearly similar; therefore,
in order to ascertain whether the disease is
inflammation of the bladder or inflammation of
the kidneys, it is necessary to introduce the
hand into the rectum, where you will find the
bladder immediately under the hand, if it feels
hard and full, accompanied by more than natural
heat and tenderness, it is a sure case of inflammation
of the bladder, but if the bladder
is empty and no increased heat is apparent, then
it must be a case of inflammation of the kidneys.</p>

<p>In treating these two diseases&mdash;though the
symptoms are so much alike&mdash;be very careful to
observe that the course of treatment recommended
in each is entirely different, and should
you give the medicine prescribed for inflammation
of the bladder for that of the kidneys, it
will greatly endanger the life of the horse.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span></p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Symptoms.</span></h4>

<p>The early symptoms in this disease are generally
those of fever, but the seat of the disease
soon becomes apparent. The horse occasionally
looks round at his flanks, stands with his hind
legs wide apart, is unwilling to lie down, straddles
as he walks, evinces great pain in turning,
shrinks when his loins are pressed; the loins feel
hot, the urine is voided in small quantities,
which is often highly colored and sometimes
bloody; he tries to urinate very often and strains
painfully, but the discharge is nearly or quite
suppressed; the pulse is quick, hard and full at
first, but rapidly becomes small, indicating a disease
of the urinary organs, yet not distinguishing
inflammation of the bladder from inflammation
of the kidneys.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Treatment&mdash;Remedy.</span></h4>

<p>When you feel satisfied that it is a case of
inflammation of the bladder, blister the loins
with the blister ointment and give 1 ounce of
turpentine with 1 ounce of laudanum.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span></p>

<h3>INFLAMMATION OF THE KIDNEYS.</h3>

<p>The symptoms of this disease are similar to
those of inflammation of the bladder, but are
to be treated in quite a different manner. Inflammation
of the kidneys is brought on by
over-riding, heavy loads, improper feeding, and
sometimes by being poled on the haunches, or
across the kidneys and loins.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Treatment&mdash;Remedy.</span></h4>

<p>Place a mustard plaster made with vinegar
across the loins and bleed. After this give an
active purge, and when it begins to abate give
of white helebore from ½ to ¾ of a drachm, and
1½ drachms of tartar emetic, with ½ a pint of
warm water, this should be repeated 2 or 3
times a day, according to the nature of the disease.
For drink, give him warm water or gruel
as much as he will drink, and keep the back
and loins warm and comfortable.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>

<h3>INFLAMMATION OF THE LUNGS.</h3>

<p>This disease is generally brought on by sudden
cold, hard driving, high feeding, &amp;c.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Symptoms.</span></h4>

<p>The first appearance of this disease is generally
marked by fits of shivering, accompanied
with a coldness throughout the entire body,
which, however, gradually wears off, and he
becomes warm, except the ears and feet; but it
sometimes commences slowly, with a hard, dry
cough, which appears to give the horse great
pain; he appears dull, and refuses to eat his
food; the pulse is obscure and oppressed&mdash;he
heaves at the flanks, the nostrils are extended,
the eye-lids and linings of the nose are inflamed
with a disagreeable running at the nose,
experiences great difficulty in breathing, seems
very stiff, is unwilling to lie down or move, and
often stands until completely exhausted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span></p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Treatment&mdash;Remedy.</span></h4>

<p>Bleed until the pulse becomes round and full,
and then the heart will be able to accomplish
its object; next hand rub the legs, well, wrap them
up with flannel bandages as high as the knees,
put a blanket on the horse to keep him warm,
but let the stable have a sufficient opening to
admit the fresh air, not so much as to make it
cold or chilly. In warm weather the horse cannot
have too much fresh air. The following
prescription will be found very beneficial:</p>

<ul>
<li>1 drachm powdered foxglove,</li>
<li>1½ <span class="ditto1">“</span> tartar emetic,</li>
<li>3 <span class="ditto2">“</span> nitre,</li>
<li>4 <span class="ditto2">“</span> tincture of aloes,</li>
<li>½ pint of warm water.</li>
</ul>

<p>Mix well, give it as a drench and clyster with
soap and warm water; when the focus has become
softened a little, <em>leave off using the tincture of
aloes</em>, but continue to administer the remaining
portion of the above prescription, and blister the
sides and brisket with the blister ointment
every 6 hours. If the ointment should act well<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
on the first application, there is no further need
for it, but should it not act properly continue
the blistering until it does, or until the parts
become very sore, and in two or three days after
dress with lard.</p>

<p>In the latter stages of the disease it will be
found very difficult to get the blister to act properly
on account of the exhaustion of the natural
powers of the animal, but it must be continued,
and the sinking energies aroused, or the
horse is lost. The blister is often prevented
from acting by the gig being up.</p>

<p>In this disease the treatment should be prompt
and decisive, as not a moment of time is to be
lost. The first object should be to subdue the
inflammation, and if the mouth continues hot,
the extremities cold, and the nose red, the horse
must be bled again and again in rapid succession,
the good that we can do must be done immediately
or not at all.</p>

<p>The first step to be taken in this disease is to
bleed profusely&mdash;let the lancet used be a large,
broad shouldered one, in order that the blood
may be extracted as quick as possible and the
disease destroyed without impairing the strength<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
of the animal. (If the blood be allowed to flow
slowly in a small stream, the strength of the
animal will be sapped, while the disease remains
untouched.) Let the blood flow until the pulse
falters and the horse begins to tremble; no harm
will be done however if he should fall by bleeding
in this disease. As soon as possible after
the bleeding, give the medicine prescribed; then
hand rub and bandage, and cover with warm
blankets; feed him on bran mash and let him
run to grass for a month.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span></p>

<h3>INFLAMMATION OF THE BOWELS.</h3>

<p>This disease arises from various causes, and
is frequently brought on by long standing costiveness,
neglected gripes, or hard riding, over
heating and immediately drinking of cold water.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Symptoms.</span></h4>

<p>In many cases of this disease fits of shivering
or restlessness are the first indications of its
approach; the mouth becomes hot, the nose red,
the horse begins to evince the most intense
pain by pawing, striking at his belly with his
feet, looking wildly at his flanks, groaning and
rolling. The pulse is quick but small, the ears
and feet cold, the belly tender to the touch and
sometimes hot, the breathing is quickened, the
bowels costive, and the horse rapidly becoming
fearfully weak. He paws and stamps as in the
colic, but the pulse is much quicker than in that
disease, and the pain becomes constant without
any intermissions, as occur in colic.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span></p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Treatment&mdash;Remedy.</span></h4>

<p>Commence by bleeding profusely, taking at
least 7 or 8 quarts of blood, or as much as the
horse can bear, which must be done immediately,
or a fatal termination may be looked for.
If the horse does not seem to have been relieved
or the pulse become round and full, the bleeding
must be repeated as the only means of
subduing the inflammation, which is the immediate
cause of the weakness. If the inflammation
is subdued by the extraction of the blood the
weakness will soon disappear. After the bleeding,
make a strong decoction of aloes and opium
or laudanum, say 1 ounce of laudanum with the
same quantity of the tincture of aloes, and give
it to the horse; this must be quickly followed
by back-raking and an injection of soap and
warm water or thin gruel, in which epsom salts
or aloes may be dissolved in moderate quantities;
repeat this until the bowels are completely cleaned
out. He should be given as much warm water
or thin gruel as he will drink, and half the quantity
of tincture of aloes and laudanum should
be administered every two or three hours until
the bowels are freely opened. Blister the sides<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
and belly with common blistering ointment and
bandage the legs up to the knees with flannel,
cover him with blankets as directed in inflammation
of the lungs, and give him a comfortable
stable, but not too hot, with plenty of fresh air.
No corn or hay should be allowed in this disease&mdash;bran
mash will answer very well for feed,
but green meat is preferable if it can be had.
Turn him out for two or three hours in the middle
of the day if not too cold; give the legs
good hand-rubbing every day; continue to clyster
with thin gruel for two or three days.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span></p>

<h3>BOTS OR GRUBS.</h3>

<p>The Bots or Grubs are small worms of a red
or brownish color, found in the stomach, and it
is considered almost impossible for them to do
any harm, but a horse that has the bots, grubs
or worms, loses flesh, becomes hide bound and
dull.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Symptoms.</span></h4>

<p>In this disease a yellowish matter is often
found under the horse’s tail; he has pain, stamps
and rolls, switches his tail between his legs,
turns up his upper lip, and frequently looks
round to his flanks, and often tries to rub his
fundament against the wall, or any other place
that he can.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Treatment&mdash;Remedy No. 1.</span></h4>

<p>First give an active purge, and if that is not
sufficient to expel them, take 2 drachms of tartar
emetic, with a small quantity of tin or pewter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
filings, or a little ground glass, make into
balls or pills, and give one every morning for
two weeks; if it is necessary, the balls can be
made with a little tar, which will also improve
the condition of the horse.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Remedy No. 2.</span></h4>

<p>Take 1 pint of common honey and give it as
a drench; in two hours after give an active
purge:&mdash;1 pint of molasses added to 1 pint of
soft soap and a handful of salt will answer
very well. Repeat the dose if it does not operate
in four or five hours.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>

<h3>MEMBRANES OF THE NOSE.<br />
<span class="smcap">Showing the Symptoms that mark the Different
Stages of the Disease.</span></h3>

<p>1st.&mdash;The pale pink hue, when the horse is
in perfect health.</p>

<p>2d.&mdash;An increased tinge of red, and the gradual
uniform painting of the membrane, indicating
some excitement of the general system.</p>

<p>3d.&mdash;The streaked appearance when inflammation
is threatening or commencing.</p>

<p>4th.&mdash;The intense florid red, of inflammation
being acute.</p>

<p>5th.&mdash;The starting of the vessels from their
gossamer coat, and their seeming to run bare
over the membranes, when inflammation has
attained its highest point.</p>

<p>6th.&mdash;The pale ground, with patches of vivid
red, showing the half subdued but still existing
fever.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>

<p>7th.&mdash;The uniform color, but of a deeper red
than natural, indicating the return of a healthy
state of the circulation.</p>

<p>8th.&mdash;A paleness approaching to white, with
a slight radiation of crimson, showing that
there is still considerable irritability, and that
mischief may be in the wind.</p>

<p>9th.&mdash;The pale, livid color, warning you that
the disease is assuming a typhoid character.</p>

<p>10th.&mdash;The deep livid, announcing that the
typhus is establishing, and that the vital current
is stagnating.</p>

<p>11th.&mdash;The brown or dirty painting, intermingling
with and subduing the lividness, denoting
that the game is up.</p>

<p>12th.&mdash;These appearances will be guides to
our opinions and treatment, which can never be
too highly appreciated.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span></p>

<h3>THE EYES.</h3>

<p>From the eye of the horse we form an idea of
his age. There is, at the back of the eye a considerable
quantity of fatty substance, on which
it may revolve easily, without friction. In aged
horses much of this disappears, the eye becomes
sunken, and the pit above it deepens: The eye
is a very important organ of the horse, and
should be large, clear, shining, lively, dark colored,
round and full, so that you may look deep
into them; when moving but a small portion of
the white should show, and the purchaser who
notices this should pause ere he completes his
bargain for a horse that shows too much of the
whites of his eyes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span></p>

<h3>THE EARS.</h3>

<p>Those who are acquainted with the nature of
the horse pay much attention to the size and
motion of the ear. Ears rather small than large,
placed not too far apart, erect and quick in motion,
indicate both breeding and spirit. If a
horse is frequently in the habit of carrying one
ear forward and the other backward, and especially
when on a journey, he generally possesses
both spirit and continuance; and if attentive to
what is taking place about him, he cannot be
much fatigued or likely soon to become so.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>

<h3>STAGGERS.</h3>

<p>A number of opinions have been advanced in
relation to the origin and seat of this disease.
Some think that it is confined entirely to the
head, while others say that the lungs are also
affected; that it originates in the stomach, from
which it is removed by the action of the lymphatic
vessels, and being thrown into the circulation
is diffused throughout the entire system,
and carried by the arteries into the lungs,
through which all the blood in a horse’s body
passes many times during an hour, where it undergoes
a change, thus depositing a portion of
the poisonous matter that had been received into
the stomach in the lungs. It is common to
horses of all ages and conditions, and is a very
rare case where it does not prove fatal.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Symptoms.</span></h4>

<p>The symptoms in this disease are feebleness,
drowsiness, loss of appetite, a constant hanging<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
of the head, with inflamed eyes, nearly closed;
he kicks, rears and plunges, seemingly unconscious
of what he is doing; it is dangerous for
any one to approach him in this state; the ears
and forehead hot, accompanied by a burning
fever.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Treatment&mdash;Remedy.</span></h4>

<p>The first step to be taken in this disease is to
relieve the overloaded organs of the brain, which
should be done by opening the neck or jugular
vein with a large lancet, that the blood may flow
freely. No definite quantity of blood need be
taken, but let it run until the horse begins to
falter and blow; or, perhaps, with more assurance
of success, until he falls. Immediately
after inject freely with warm water, and give as
a drench ½ ounce of aloes, ½ ounce of ginger,
and ½ pint of warm water; feed on bran mash
and green meal.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span></p>

<h3>RABIES OR MADNESS.</h3>

<p>If a horse be bitten by a dog or horse that is
affected with rabies or madness, the wound
should be well burned out with caustic, (nitrate
of silver,) and on the third day after remove the
scab and repeat the operation. The caustic
should reach every part of the wound.</p>

<p>The following remedy has often been administered,
and found effectual in nine cases out of
every ten. Take</p>

<ul>
<li>2 ounces of fresh leaves of tree-box,</li>
<li>2 <span class="ditto1">“</span> <span class="ditto3">“</span> of rue,</li>
<li>½ <span class="ditto1">“</span> sage,</li>
</ul>

<p>Chop these very fine and boil in a pint of water
down to half a pint; strain carefully, and press
out the liquor, put back the ingredients into a
pint of milk, and boil again to half a pint;
strain as before, mix both liquors, which forms
three doses for a human subject. Double this
quantity for a horse or cow. Two-thirds of the
quantity is sufficient for a large dog, half for a
middling sized, and one-third for a small dog.
Three doses are sufficient each subsequent morning
fasting, giving the quantity directed, being
that which forms these three doses.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span></p>

<h3>INJURY OF THE EYE.</h3>

<p>The eye itself of the horse is rarely injured
by blows and bruises carelessly inflicted by passionate
persons, but the substance that surrounds
it may be seriously wounded, and considerable
inflammation ensue&mdash;this may be abated by the
application of poultices, bleeding and physicing.
Sometimes the eye-lids become inflamed from
the same cause&mdash;fomentations of warm water
will be serviceable in this case. The horse occasionally
has a scaly eruption on the edges of the
eye-lids, attended with much itching, in the
effort to allay which the eye is often blemished
by being rubbed against some hard substance&mdash;the
nitriated ointment of quicksilver, mixed
with an equal quantity of lard may be slightly
rubbed on the edges of the lids, with good effect.
Warts are sometimes attached to the edges of
the lids, and are a source of great irritation&mdash;they
should be removed with a pair of sharp
scissors, and their roots touched with lunar
caustic. In common inflammation of the eye,
free bleeding, cooling applications, physic and
mash diet will usually allay the evil; the tincture
of opium is a good lotion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span></p>

<h3>LAMPASS.</h3>

<p>The lampass is a swelling of the gums on the
inner side of the upper jaw, to which young
horses are mostly subject, and sometimes suffer
considerably before it is discovered.</p>

<p>In some cases the swelling will subside without
further medical treatment than administering
a few alteratives, and feeding on bran
mashes, but should this fail it will have to be
cured by cutting across the bars with a lancet or
pen-knife. If, however, it returns in three or
four months after this operation, which it sometimes
does, take a sharp, flat piece of iron, a
little crooked at one end, heat it and burn out
the disease a little below the level of the teeth,
being very careful not to let the iron rest or bear
against the teeth. After this operation give the
horse a little meal, mixed with a small quantity
of salt, and feed on mashes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>

<h3>THE PROCESS OF TEETHING.</h3>

<p>At 1½ years of age the mark in the central
nippers will be much shorter and fainter; that
in the other pairs will have undergone an evident
change, and all the nippers become flat.</p>

<p>At 2 years this will be more manifest, and
about this period a fifth will appear. Now,
likewise, another process is commencing: the
first teeth are adapted to the size and wants of
the young animal, and are sufficiently large to
fill the colt’s jaws.</p>

<p>At 3 years old the horse should have the central
permanent nippers growing, the other two
pairs wasting away; six grinders in each jaw
above and below, the first and fifth level with
the others, and the sixth protruding; the sharp
edge of the incisors, which will be very evident
when compared to the neighboring teeth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span></p>

<p>At 4 years the central nippers will be fully
developed, with the edge somewhat worn off,
and the mark in them shorter, wider and fainter;
the next pair will have made their appearance
with the mark deep, and extending entirely
across them. The corner nippers will be larger
than the inside ones, yet smaller than they were
and flat, with the mark nearly effaced. The
sixth grinder will have become level with the
others, and the tushes beginning to make their
appearance.</p>

<p>At 5 years the horse’s mouth is almost perfect.
The corner nippers are quite up with the
long, deep mark, irregular on the inside, and
the other nippers bearing evident tokens of increasing
wearing. The tush is much grown,
the grooves have almost or quite disappeared,
and the outer surface is regularly convex.</p>

<p>At 6 years the mark on the central nippers is
worn out, though there is still a difference in
the color of the centre of the teeth. The cement
filling the hole, made by the dipping in
of enamel, will present a browner hue than the
other part of the teeth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p>

<p>At 7 years the mark in the manner which we
have described it, has worn out in the four central
nippers, and is fast disappearing in the
corner teeth; the tush also is beginning to alter&mdash;it
is rounding at the point, the edges, and
without, and beginning to get round inside.</p>

<p>At 8 years old the tush is rounded in every
way, the mark has disappeared from all the bottom
nippers, and it may almost be said to be out
of the mouth. There is nothing remaining in
the bottom nippers afterward that can clearly
show the age of the horse.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span></p>

<h3>CHEST FOUNDER.</h3>

<p>I believe this disease to be nothing more than
the rheumatism, produced by suffering the horse
to remain too long tied up and exposed to the
cold, or riding him against a very bleak wind.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Symptoms.</span></h4>

<p>The horse has considerable stiffness in moving,
evidently not arising from the feet; there
is a tenderness about the muscles of the breast
and occasional swelling; it is sometimes accompanied
with a considerable degree of fever.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Treatment&mdash;Remedy.</span></h4>

<p>Bleeding, physic, and a rowel in the chest,
warm stabling and warm clothing, with occasional
doses of antimonial powder, will soon
subdue the complaint.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span></p>

<h3>INFLAMMATION.</h3>

<p>Inflammation consists of an increased flow of
the blood to and through the parts. The proper
mode of abating which is to lessen the quantity
of blood&mdash;if we take away the fuel, the fire
will go out&mdash;all other means are comparatively
unimportant contrasted with bleeding. Blood
is generally extracted from the jugular vein, so
that the general quantity may be lessened, but
if it can be taken from the neighborhood of the
diseased part, it will be productive of tenfold
benefit: one quart of blood extracted from the
foot in acute founder, will do more good than
five quarts taken from the general circulation;
an ounce of blood obtained by scarifying the
swollen vessels of the inflamed eye, will give as
much relief to that organ as a copious bleeding
from the jugular. This is a principle in the
animal’s nature which should never be lost sight
of; hence the necessity for bleeding early and
largely in inflammation of the lungs, or of the
bowels, or of the brain, or of any important organ.
Many horses are lost for want of, or insufficiency<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
in bleeding, but we never knew of
one being materially injured by the most copious
extraction of blood.</p>

<p>It is very difficult to decide when a cold or
hot application is to be used, and no general
rule can be laid down, except that in cases of
inflammation in the early stages, cold will be
preferable, but when the inflammation is deeper
seated or fully established, warm fomentations
will be found most serviceable. Stimulating
applications are frequently used in local inflammation.
When the disease is deeply seated, a
stimulating application to the skin will cause
some irritation and inflammation there, and
lessen or remove the malady; hence the use
of rowels and blisters in inflammation of the
chest. If we excite it in one, we shall abate it
in the other,&mdash;and also, by the discharge which
we establish from the one, we shall lessen the
determination of the other. Stimulating and
blistering applications should never be applied
to a part that is already inflamed. A fire
will not go out by heaping more fuel upon it;
hence the mischief which is often done by rubbing
those abominable oils on a recent sprain,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
hot and tender. Many a horse has been ruined
by this absurd treatment, when the heat and
tenderness have disappeared by the use of cold
lotions or fomentations. When the leg or
sprained part remains enlarged long or matter
threatens to be deposited, it may be right to
excite inflammation of the skin by a blister, in
order to rouse the deeper seated absorbants to
action and enable them to take up this deposit;
but, except to hasten the natural process and
effects of inflammation, a blister or stimulating
application should never be applied to a part
already inflamed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span></p>

<h3>INFLAMMATION OF THE LARYNX.</h3>

<p>He who is desirous of ascertaining whether
there is any disease in the larynx of a horse,
should apply his ear to the lower part of the
windpipe. If he finds that the air passes in and
out without interruption, there is no disease of
any consequence, either in the windpipe or the
chest, for it would be immediately detected by
the loudness or the interruption of the murmur.
Then let him gradually proceed up the neck
with his ear still upon the windpipe; perhaps he
soon begins to recognize a little gurgling sound.
He can have no surer proof that there is the
seat of the disease.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Treatment&mdash;Remedy.</span></h4>

<p>The treatment here is very plain: Blood must
be copiously extracted from the jugular vein,
which must be done quickly, letting it run until<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
the pulse begins to flutter, then administer the
fever medicine:</p>

<ul>
<li>1 drachm digitalis,</li>
<li>1½ <span class="ditto1">“</span> emetic tartar,</li>
<li>3 <span class="ditto2">“</span> nitre,</li>
<li>½ ounce aloes,</li>
</ul>

<p>Which must be repeated twice or thrice in the
day. Aloes may be safely given at this stage
of the disease, because the chest is not yet implicated.
To this must be added immediately
a blister, and a sharp one.</p>

<h3>EPIDEMICS.</h3>

<p>In epidemics all offensive matter should be
immediately and carefully cleared away, and
no small portion of the chloride of lime used in
washing the stables, troughs, &amp;c., and particularly
his ulcers, &amp;c.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span></p>

<h3>CHRONIC COUGH.</h3>

<p>If a harsh hollow cough is accompanied by a
staring coat; it proceeds from irritability of the
air passages, which will be discovered by the
horse coughing after drinking, or when he first
goes out of the stable in the morning, or by
occasionally snorting out thick mucus from the
nose, medicine may be given with advantage to
diminish the irritation; generally small doses
of digitalis, emetic tartar and nitre administered
at night. Take</p>

<ul>
<li>Digitalis ½ drachm,</li>
<li>Emetic tartar 1 drachm,</li>
<li>Nitre 1 drachm.</li>
</ul>

<p>This should be mixed into a ball with tar and
given every night regularly for a considerable
length of time. A blister extending from the
root of one ear to that of the other, taking in
the whole of the channel and reaching six or
eight inches down the windpipe has been tried
with good effect. Feeding has much influence
on this complaint: too much dry meat, and especially
chaff increases it; carrots afford decided
relief.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span></p>

<h3>THICK OR BROKEN WIND.</h3>

<p>There is no remedy for the cure of this but
it may be improved. The horse should have
full proportions of solid food, but very little
hay, and no chaff; he should not be worked immediately
after a heavy meal; water should be
given in moderate quantities, but the horse
should not be suffered to drink as much as he
likes until the day’s work is over; green meat
will always be serviceable, and carrots are particularly
useful.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span></p>

<h3>PHYSICING.</h3>

<p>A horse should be carefully prepared for the
action of physic. Two or three bran mashes
given on that or the preceding day, which should
be continued until the dung becomes softened,
as a less quantity of physic will then suffice.
On the day which the physic is given, the horse
should have walking exercise, or may be gently
trotted for a quarter of an hour twice in the
day; but after the physic begins to work, he
should not be moved from his stall. A little
hay may be put in the rack, and as much mash
given as the horse will eat, and as much water
as he will drink with the coldness off. Aloes is
the best purgative, for there is no other that is at
once so sure and safe&mdash;the dose is from ½ to 1
ounce, if the horse is properly prepared. The
only other purgative on which dependence can be
placed is the croton; the dose varies from 1 scruple
to ½ a drachm. Linseed oil is an uncertain
but safe purgative, in doses from a pint to a pint
and a half. Epsom salts are an inefficacious
remedy except in the immense dose of a pound
and a half, and then they are not always safe.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span></p>

<h3>SPRAINS OF THE BACK SINEWS.</h3>

<p>Should there remain the slightest lameness
or enlargement, the leg must be blistered; and
it would seldom be a bad practice to blister after
every case of severe sprain. The inflammation
may lay deep, and the part once sprained may
long remain weak, and subject to renewed
injury, not from unusual but ordinary exertion.
The horse should be afterwards turned out for
one or two months.</p>

<p>We must here again repeat that a blister
should never be used while any heat remains.</p>

<h3>ENLARGEMENT OF THE HOCK.</h3>

<p>A horse with an enlarged hock must always
be regarded with suspicion: in truth he is unsound.
The animal may discharge his usual
work during a long period, without return of
lameness, but when all his energies are required,
the weakened part will fail. The treatment is
plain enough: fomentations, blistering, &amp;c. may
remedy the evil.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>

<h3>SPRAIN OF THE COFFIN JOINT.</h3>

<p>The proof of this is when the lameness is
sudden, and the heat and tenderness are principally
felt around the cornet. Bleeding at the
toe, physic, fomentations and blisters are the
usual means adopted. This lameness is not
easily removed even by a blister, and if removed
like sprains of the fetlock and of the back sinews,
it is apt to return again. Sprains of the
coffin joint sometimes become a very serious
affair; not being attended by any swelling, and
being detected only by heat around the coronet.
First reduce the heat by fomentations: say bathe
the foot with water as warm as the hand will
bear, fomentate with this for 15 or 20 minutes&mdash;the
long continuance of fomentations has been
found very efficacious in reducing inflammation;
next apply a clay poultice made with vinegar,
and when getting dry moisten by pouring vinegar
on the foot and clay. After the heat has
left the parts, then blister. The horse should
not be used for a month or two.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span></p>

<h3>GREASE.</h3>

<p>Grease consists of swollen legs, although
swelled legs occur frequently, yet there is no
grease. Friction and bandaging will generally
remove this. Grease is a specific inflammation
of the skin of the heels, sometimes of the forefeet,
but oftener of the hinder ones. It is not
a contagious disease, as some have asserted
although when it once appears in a stable, it
frequently attacks almost every horse in it.&mdash;Bad
stable management is the true cause of it.
The first appearance of grease is usually a dry
and scurfy state of the skin of the heel, with
redness, heat and itching. The heel should be
well but gently washed with soap and water,
and as much of the scurf detached as is easily
removed. If the cracks are deep, with an ichorous
discharge and considerable lameness, it
will be necessary to poultice. A poultice made
of carrots boiled soft and mashed will answer
the purpose. The efficacy of a carrot poultice
is seldom sufficiently appreciated in cases like
this. The poultice just referred to should be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
diligently applied at night, to insure success,
and when the heat and tenderness and stiffness
of motion have diminished, astringent lotions
should be applied. Either the alum lotion or a
strong decoction of oak bark&mdash;perhaps the alum
dissolved in whiskey will do better than water,
or the alum dissolved in a decoction of bark will
answer better than either. This disease requires
perseverance&mdash;the decoctions should be made
very strong. After washing several times should
there be watery matter on the heels or leg, wash
it off with wafer and soap. Moderate physicing,
bran mashes, &amp;c. will be found very beneficial.
The above decoctions will never fail to
cure the scratches.</p>

<h3>INFLAMMATION OF THE FEET, ACUTE
FOUNDER.</h3>

<p>This is a disease that was less understood than
any other until very recently. It often arises
by allowing a horse that is very much heated to
stand in the snow or cold water for any length
of time, or where he is apt to become chilled,
which produces a general stiffness throughout
the entire system; but it will soon be observed
that the seat of the disease is in the feet, by the
disinclination of the horse to remain upon them.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Symptoms.</span></h4>

<p>The earliest symptoms of fever in the feet are
restiveness, frequent shifting of the fore legs,
but no pawing. The pulse is quickened, the
flanks heaving, the nostrils red and his moaning
indicating great pain. He looks about his
litter, as if preparing to lie down; he continues
to shift his weight from foot to foot; he is afraid
to draw his feet sufficiently under him for the
purpose of lying down, but at length he drops.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
His lying down will distinguish inflammation
of the feet from that of the lungs, in which the
horse obstinately persists in standing until he
drops. His quietness when down will distinguish
it from colic or inflammation of the bowels.
He will point out the seat of the disease by
looking at the part; his muzzle will often rest
on the feet or affected foot.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Treatment&mdash;Remedy No. 1.</span></h4>

<p>The treatment in this disease resembles that
of other inflammations. Bleeding is indispensable
and that to its fullest extent. Four quarts of
blood should be taken from the toe of the foot,
which may be put into warm water to quicken
the flow of blood. Poultices of linseed meal,
made very soft, should cover the whole of the
foot and pastern, and be frequently renewed.
This will relieve its painful pressure on the
swelled and tender parts beneath. The shoe
should be removed, the sole pared as thin as possible,
the crust and quarters well washed&mdash;all
this should be done gently. Sedatives and cooling
medicines should be diligently administered,
consisting of digitalis, nitre and tartar emetic,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
1 drachm digitalis, 2 drachms tartar emetic, 3
drachm saltpetre. If no amendment is apparent
after this, blood should again be extracted
on the following day. In extreme cases, a third
bleeding may be justifiable, and instead of the
poultice, cloths kept wet with water in which
nitre has been dissolved, in the proportion of
an ounce of nitre to a pint of water. The
cloths should be wrapped around the feet.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Treatment&mdash;Remedy No. 2.</span></h4>

<p>Take 1 quart sweet milk, 1 quart molasses,
½ oz. pulverized saltpetre, mix and dissolve all
together, give in 2 drenches about 5 minutes
apart: this is highly recommended by those who
have tried it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span></p>

<h3>RESTIVENESS, OR TAMING HORSES.</h3>

<p>Mr. Catlin has published an account, the
veracity of which is unimpeached, of his travels
among the North American Indians. “He coils
his lasso on his arm and gallops fearlessly into
the herd of wild horses. He soon gets it over
the neck of one of the number, when he instantly
dismounts, leaving his own horse, letting the
lasso pass out gradually and carefully through
his hands until the horse falls for want of breath.
The Indian advances, keeping the lasso tight
upon his neck until he fastens a pair of hobbles
on the animals two fore feet,&mdash;then passing a
noose round the under jaw by which he obtains
great power over the affrighted animal, that is
rearing and plunging when it gets breath. By
this means he gradually advances until he is
able to place his hand on the animal nose and
over its eyes, and at length to breathe into its
nostrils, when it soon becomes docile and conquered;
so that he has little else to do than
remove the hobbles from its feet, and lead or
ride it to the camp.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. A. B. Moss happened to read this account,
and he felt a natural desire to ascertain
how far this mode of horse training might be
employed among the American horses. He
soon had an opportunity of putting the veracity
of the story to the test. A man on a neighboring
farm was attempting to break a very restive
colt, which had foiled him in every possible way.
After several attempts, he succeeded in breathing
into one of the horse’s nostrils, and from
that moment all became easy. The horse was
completely subdued. He suffered himself to be
led quietly away with a loose halter, and was
perfectly at command.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span></p>

<h3>BROOD MARES.</h3>

<p>Great care and attention should be paid to
brood mares, particularly three or four weeks
before foaling. She should be worked up to the
day of foaling, being very careful not to overwork
or exert her too much; light and moderate
work is an advantage to the animal with
foal. She should be fed on a little flax seed
meal, or the whole seed if the meal cannot be
obtained, twice a week at least six or eight
weeks before foaling, and should never fail to
turn out to grass of a night for several
weeks previous to foaling. Should be fed on
bran mash through the winter, and up to the
time of foaling, which will be found very advantageous
to both mare and colt. There is
nothing so refreshing as a bran mash with a
little salt in it, adding a reasonable quantity of
corn and oats. If this course and caution is
taken you will not lose one mare out of a hundred,
and perhaps not one out of a thousand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span></p>

<h3>WARTS.</h3>

<p>Warts are found on the eye-lids, the muzzel,
the ears, the belly, the neck, the penis, and the
prepuce. There are some caustics available, but
frequently they must be removed by an operation.</p>

<p>If the root is very small it may be snapped
asunder close to the skin with a pair of scissors,
and touched with lunar caustic.</p>

<p>If the pedicle or stem is somewhat larger, a
ligature of waxed silk should be passed firmly
round it and tightened every day. The source
of nutriment being thus removed the tumor will
in a short time die and drop off.</p>

<p>If the warts are large or in considerable clusters,
it will be necessary to cast the horse in
order to cut them off close to the skin. The
root should then be seared with a red hot iron;
unless these precautions are used the warts will
speedily sprout out again.</p>

<p>Mix and pulverize well. The glass should be
ground through a fine mill two or three times.
If the benedict and spice berries cannot be obtained
it will do well without them.</p>

<h4>DIRECTIONS FOR USE.</h4>

<p>The dose is 1 table spoonful night and morning,
with bran mash or oats, which can be increased
or diminished to suit the case. By
leaving out tobacco it will make an excellent
powder for cows, hogs, sheep, &amp;c.</p>

<h3>TO CURE GALDS ON HORSES.</h3>

<p>Take dry white lead and sprinkle it on the
gald twice a day, which will dry it up and cure
it in a short time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span></p>

<h3>ARABIAN OIL FOR HORSES.</h3>

<p>This oil is an excellent mixture for sprains,
swellings, galds, &amp;c. either for a human subject
or a horse. Take</p>

<ul>
<li>1 quart of linseed oil,</li>
<li>1 pint of turpentine,</li>
<li>4 ounces oil of origanum</li>
<li>6 <span class="ditto1">“</span> oil of spike,</li>
<li>6 <span class="ditto1">“</span> spirits of camphor,</li>
<li>1 <span class="ditto1">“</span> oil of sassafras.</li>
</ul>

<p>Mix and shake well before using, and keep the
vessel that contains it well corked. The spirits
of camphor is made by taking 95 per cent.
alcohol, adding as much gum camphor as it
will dissolve.</p>

<h3>FOR THE BOTS.</h3>

<p>Dissolve in a pint of milk warm water ¼ lb.
of alum and give it as a drench; in ten minutes
after give 1 pint of linseed oil.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></p>

<h3>AN INFALLIBLE LOTION
FOR BLOWS, BRUISES, SWELLINGS, SPRAINS, &amp;C.</h3>

<p>This lotion is truly astonishing in its effects,
and cannot be surpassed for the purposes for
which it is intended. Dissolve 2 ounces of gum
camphor in 1 pint of 95 per cent. alcohol, and
when dissolved add</p>

<ul>
<li>2 ounces oil of turpentine,</li>
<li>2 <span class="ditto1">“</span> spirits sal amoniac,</li>
<li>1 <span class="ditto1">“</span> oil origanum,</li>
<li>2 tablespoonsful laudanum.</li>
</ul>

<p>This lotion must be well rubbed in with the
hand for a full quarter of an hour every time it
is used, which should be four times a day.</p>

<h3>FOR THE BLACK TONGUE.</h3>

<p>Take a handful of fine salt and rub well upon
the tongue of the horse that has this disease,
which will effect a cure in two applications. It
is an infallible, simple and cheap remedy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span></p>

<h3>LOTION FOR SCRATCHES OR GREASE.</h3>

<p>Take white oak bark and make a strong decoction
of it by boiling; then dissolve a portion
of pulverized alum in the decoction, say ½ pound
of alum to a quart of decoction, and it is ready
for use. Before applying the lotion, wash the
parts with warm soap suds two or three times a
day. This lotion has never been known to fail
when properly applied. A lotion made of alum
and water is said to be good.</p>

<h3>TO QUIET OR TAME HORSES.</h3>

<p>Take of the oil of roses 4 drops, oil of cummin
4 drops, and a portion of the wart or horney
substance that forms on the leg, powder it fine;
then drop the oil in and mix it in your hand,
put some up the horse’s nostrils, and give him
some in his feed. This is said to be a certain
remedy for taming horses, so that you may handle
them as you please.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span></p>

<h3>TREATMENT OF FOUNDER.</h3>

<p>As soon as it is ascertained that the horse is
foundered, take from the neck vein from 1 to 2
gallons of blood; then give 1 ounce of pulverized
alum, mixed with damp oats; place the horse
in a dry stall, ground floor is best, wrap the legs
up as high as the knees and hock joints, with
woollen cloths, saturate them with cold water
for seven or eight hours; give him no food for
twenty-four hours, and then let it be a light
feed of oats and bran mash mixed. In two or
three days turn him out for exercise. If the
ankles continue feverish, bathe them at night
with equal parts of vinegar, alcohol and sweet
oil.</p>

<h3>FOR URINE BOUND.</h3>

<p>Take dandeline leaves, make a strong decoction
and drench freely. A decoction made of
water-melon seeds will answer the same purpose.
Whiskey will generally accomplish the
object.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span></p>

<h3>FOR THE DISTEMPER.</h3>

<p>Give the horse indigo water to drink: feed on
bran mash mixed with a small quantity of sulphor
or brimstone; or you may use some good
horse powders, adding thereto a little of the
brimstone. The easiest mode to tincture the
water with the indigo is to put it into a common
muslin bag; then dip the bag into the water,
letting it remain until the water becomes bluish,
or until you think it contains a sufficient
quantity of the indigo. Give no other water to
drink. This is a safe remedy.</p>

<h3>HOOF OINTMENT.</h3>

<p>Take 1 pound of tar and 1 pound of tallow,
mix them with ½ pound of common turpentine
in a stone ware dish; stir them until they are
thoroughly mixed together. This is an excellent
dressing for sore hoofs, for horses and oxen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span></p>

<h3>EMBROCATION FOR THE THROAT.</h3>

<p>This embrocation may be used without taking
the hair off. Take</p>

<ul>
<li>2 ounces spirits of hartshorn,</li>
<li>2 <span class="ditto1">“</span> oil of turpentine,</li>
<li>2 <span class="ditto1">“</span> spirits of camphor,</li>
<li>1<span class="ditto1">“</span> laudanum.</li>
</ul>

<p>Mix well and put into a bottle; keep it well
corked.</p>

<h3>TO MAKE ELDER OINTMENT.</h3>

<p>Take the green leaves of elder, if they can be
had; if not, take of the inside bark any quantity
and lard in proportion to the elder, then fry to
a crisp, which will be found very efficacious in
healing sores, scalds, burns, sprains, or any humorous
swelling. The elder alone fried in the
same manner and strained, makes a much better
ointment. This is worth making and keeping
on hand, as its cost is a mere trifle.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span></p>

<h3>FOR BLOOD OR BOG SPAVIN.</h3>

<p>For curing the above disease dress with mercurial
ointment two or three times, and then
with iodine ointment. To make mercurial ointment,
take 1 ounce of quicksilver to 3 ounces of
lard, beat both together until thoroughly mixed.
Iodine ointment is made by mixing equal quantities
of iodine and mercurial ointment well together.</p>

<h3>A GOOD HORSE POWDER.</h3>

<p>The following prescription will make an excellent
powder for ordinary purposes. Take</p>

<ul>
<li>2 pounds sulphor of brimstone,</li>
<li>2 <span class="ditto1">“</span> cream of tartar,</li>
<li>1 <span class="ditto1">“</span> antimonia,</li>
<li>1 <span class="ditto1">“</span> saltpetre.</li>
</ul>

<p>The dose of this mixture is 1 table spoonful
morning and evening.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span></p>

<h3>ON BLISTERING.</h3>

<p>The Spanish fly in its action is intense, yet
superficial. It plentifully raises the cuticle, yet
rarely injures the true skin and therefore seldom
blemishes. The application of other acrid
substances is occasionally followed by deeply
seated ulceration; but a blister composed of the
Spanish fly alone, while it does its duty, leaves,
after a few weeks have passed, scarcely a trace
behind. The art of blistering consists in cutting
or rather shaving the hair close, then rubbing
on the ointment at least ten minutes. As
soon as the vesicles have risen, which will be in
something like 20 hours, you may relieve the
animal by the application of olive or neatsfoot
oil. In inflammation of the lungs, &amp;c., it
should be made to act sooner. The principle of
the blister is, that no intense inflammation can
exist in the neighboring parts at the same time.
An infusion of 2 ounces of the flies in 1 pint of
oil of turpentine, for several days, is frequently
used, and with good effect. This is a sure and
safe remedy. If in the winter blanket the horse
to keep him warm until he is over it; put a
blanket over the head also if very cold.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span></p>

<h3>TINCTURE OF ALOES AND MYRRH.</h3>

<p>This will answer well for dressing either fresh
or old wounds. Take</p>

<ul>
<li>8 ounces of powdered aloes,</li>
<li>1 <span class="ditto2">“</span> <span class="ditto2">“</span> myrrh,</li>
<li>1 quart spirits of wine,</li>
<li>1 ounce water,</li>
</ul>

<p>Put these into a bottle and shake every day for
two weeks, when it will be ready for use. This
is an excellent preparation, and can be relied
on. Any person having horses should never be
without this tincture, the cost being but a mere
trifle, and will often and in every case save time,
trouble and expense, where there is use for it.</p>

<h3>TINCTURE OF OPIUM.</h3>

<p>To make the above take 2 ounces of powdered
opium and 2 pints spirits of wine, put into a
bottle and shake well every day for a week,
when it will be ready for use.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span></p>

<h3>COMMON BLISTERING OINTMENT.</h3>

<p>To make the above ointment which may be
used for blistering in inflammation of the lungs,
bowels, &amp;c. Take</p>

<ul>
<li>1½ pounds of lard,</li>
<li>2  ounces venice turpentine,</li>
<li>2 <span class="ditto2">“</span>rosin,</li>
<li>2½ <span class="ditto1">“</span> spanish flies, powdered,</li>
</ul>

<p>Melt the rosin, turpentine and lard in any common
vessel, and when the mixture begins to cool
put in the powdered flies; mix well by stirring.
Before applying the blister clip or shave the
hair off and grease, rub well for ten minutes.
After it has acted, grease with lard or oil.</p>

<h3>FOR RING BONE OR SPAVIN.</h3>

<p>The following will be found very useful for
removing ring bone or spavin, or any other bony
substance. Take</p>

<ul>
<li>8 ounces of spanish flies,</li>
<li>1 pound of lard,</li>
<li>1 <span class="ditto2">“</span> rosin,</li>
<li>6 ounces of venice turpentine,</li>
</ul>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span></p>

<p>Melt the lard, rosin and turpentine over a slow
fire, and when beginning to cool add the spanish
flies. Apply three mornings in succession; and
in twelve hours after the last application dress
with lard; keep out of the water while blistering,
which may be reduced with oil and used
for the purpose of irritating and removing inflammation,
lameness, &amp;c. The horse should
not get wet while blistering.</p>

<h3>SPIRITS OF PIMENTO.</h3>

<p>To make spirits of pimento take</p>

<ul>
<li>½ pound of ground allspice,</li>
<li>1 quart of alcohol.</li>
<li>1 <span class="ditto1">“</span> of water,</li>
</ul>

<p>Put these into a bottle and shake well before
using. It is now ready for use though it is better
to let it stand several days. This is a good
lotion for the wind colic after the gas has been
removed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span></p>

<h3>TINCTURE OF IODINE.</h3>

<p>To make this tincture take 1 ounce of iodine,
1 pint of spirits of wine, and mix well. It is
very good for enlarged glands of the neck, joints
and muscles, and may be used twice a day without
taking the hair off.</p>

<h3>LINIMENT FOR SPRAINS, SWELLINGS,
&amp;c.</h3>

<p>To make this liniment, which will never fail
in curing sprains, swellings, &amp;c. &amp;c. Take</p>

<ul>
<li>2 ounces hartshorn,</li>
<li>2 <span class="ditto1">“</span> spirits camphor,</li>
<li>1 <span class="ditto1">“</span> oil of turpentine,</li>
<li>½ <span class="ditto1">“</span> laudanum.</li>
</ul>

<p>Mix well together and put into a bottle, being
careful to keep it well corked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span></p>

<h3>COOLING LOTION FOR INFLAMMATION</h3>

<p>This is an excellent lotion for wounds of the
eyes, &amp;c. to be used after bleeding freely. Take</p>

<ul>
<li>2 drachms sugar of lead,</li>
<li>1 <span class="ditto2">“</span> white vitriol,</li>
<li>1 pint lime water.</li>
</ul>

<p>Put them into a bottle and shake often, so as to
dissolve the ingredients. Apply it as a wash,
bathing the parts affected two or three times a
day.</p>

<h3>FOR THE SWEANEY.</h3>

<p>This is a troublesome disease, and is very
common amongst horses. It can easily be detected
by examining the withers, which will be
slightly sunk, and the skin becomes very tight
to the muscles and flesh; and if suffered to run
on, the horse will get very lame and the skin
tight, and the withers much sunken. I have
seen horses frequently have it on the rump or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
near the hip bone; it would cause the horse to
become very lame. This disease should be
attacked when first discovered, and never suffer
it to run on until the horse becomes very lame
and the parts much sunken.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Remedy.</span></h4>

<ul>
<li>Take 1 pint strong vinegar,</li>
<li><span class="ditto1">“</span> 1 gill spirits turpentine,</li>
<li><span class="ditto1">“</span> 1 oz. pulverized saltpetre.</li>
</ul>

<p>Put all into a bottle, shake, mix and dissolve
well, and it is fit for use. Rub the liniment on
the sunken parts with the hand as much as will
soak in twice a day, until it becomes sore, and
the skin gets loose; then apply once a day until
all is used. This liniment will never fail in
curing if applied properly, and is the only safe
and sure remedy for sweaney. I have never
known it to fail; you may grease with sweet
oil 1 day after using the last time. This liniment
will take off the hair, but it will do no
harm, as the hair will come out in a short time
as fine as ever, and will not leave the least
blemish. The liniment must act on the skin,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
and if it does not make sore or act on the skin,
add more spirits turpentine. If you have a
horse that has the sweaney, do not put yourself
to the trouble of getting any person to cure it
for you, or purchase any quack medicine for it;
but go to work and cure it yourself, which can
be done for 12½ cents. The horse should not
be worked while using it. I have known it to
be cured whilst working the horse, but the animal
should not be punished in that way. In
case the first dose does not entirely relieve, use
the second time: this you will have no need for
if you do not work the horse.</p>

<h3>HOW TO THROW OR MAKE A HORSE
LAY DOWN.</h3>

<p>Whatever you may intend the horse to do, it
is always necessary to give him some idea what
you wish him to do, and repeat whatever it may
be until the horse is sure to remember it. To
make a horse lay down, bend the left fore leg
until the hoof is nearly bottom upwards; then
fasten a loop over his leg above the pastern
joint firmly, so that he cannot get the foot
down: next fasten one end of another strap
around his right foot above his hoof; place the
strap through the left leg where it is bent; keep
the strap in your right hand; keep on the left
side of the horse; let the bridle have a strap to
it; bring this up over the opposite-side of his
neck, grasp it with your left hand, drawing the
strap steady, so as to draw his head to the right;
pull steady with the right hand strap, bearing
against the shoulder to cause him to move; when
he does move, he will come on his knees; keep
the strap tight, so that he cannot straighten his
leg; keep him in this position, turning his head<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
towards you; bear against his side slightly with
your shoulder with an equal pressure; in ten
minutes or so, he will be down. As soon as he
is down, he will be conquered; and you can
handle as you please; keep his head up, now you
may take off the straps, straighten out his legs,
rub him about the face, head and neck with your
hand the way the hair lays; handle all his legs
gently, and he will soon learn that you won’t
do him any harm. After he has laid some 15
or 20 minutes, let him get up again. Rest him
a short time, and make him lay down again as
before: repeat the operation three or four times
which is sufficient for one lesson; give him 3 or
4 lessons, and he will lay down by taking hold
of one foot, and tapping him on the other leg
with a stick while you have hold of his foot&mdash;finally
he will lay down from the motion of the
stick. Before you attempt to make a horse lay
down, place a thick bed of hay on the floor or
ground, so that he cannot hurt himself in the
least. If your horse is very scarry, fretful or
skittish after you have given him one or two
lessons, take something that will rattle or any
thing that is calculated to frighten him, rattle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
it and pass over his head and about him; he may
be much frightened at first, keep his head up,
and he cannot get up, and by continuing with
this, he will soon get used to it and not mind it.
It will be the same with a kicking horse after
you pass over him with harness, chains, &amp;c. he
will soon become accustomed to it, so that you
can hitch him up and work him with safety.&mdash;In
all cases where horses have been broke of bad
habits, you should be cautious not to show him
opportunities to learn his old tricks over. The
most gentle horse can be spoiled and brought
into bad habits; so you should be careful with
the one that has just been broke from his bad
habits.</p>

<p>The above is the only safe and sure course
which you can pursue with a horse with bad
habits. I would here again press upon you
when you have him on his knees, to commence
patting him under the belly&mdash;continue with
gentle strokes upon the belly. You will in a
few minutes bring him to his knees behind:
continue the process and he will lay down and
submit himself to your treatment. By proceeding
gently you may handle his feet and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
legs any way you choose. By practising this
process a few times, you will find him perfectly
gentle and submissive, and will generally follow
you, and is unwilling to leave you unless he be
very wild; the first treatment will answer.&mdash;Should
you have a very wild horse, and cannot
manage him, take the button or horney substance
which grows on the back part of the
horse’s leg; dry this, pulverize it fine, drop a
few drops of oil of roses and a few drops oil
cummin; put some of this up his nostrils: this
is best done by putting it in a large quill and
blowing it up the nostril; feed him with a small
portion of it from off your hand, with a little
oats; also breathe your breath into his nostrils;
by doing this, he will permit you to handle his
feet, legs, &amp;c. or permit you to get on his back,
or suffer you to handle as you please. By pursuing
these courses, and handling occasionally,
always letting him know what you want him
to do, you will be able to quiet and tame a horse
to become perfectly gentle.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span></p>

<h3>RULES FOR A HORSE THAT SHYES.</h3>

<p>When you have a horse that shyes or scares
at a stump, log or any object that may come in
his way, never whip him for it, or attempt to
force him up to it or by it. But be easy with
him, try and get him up to the object by gentle
handling; patting and rubbing him on the neck,
shoulders, &amp;c. Finally you will get him up to
the object, and he will smell or feel it with his
nose. If you pursue this course he will finally
forget and give up the habit of scaring. If you
wish to satisfy yourself about this course, take
a buffalo robe or a red blanket, place your horse
in a yard and hold up the robe, moving towards
him; he will soon throw up his head, snort and
run. Then throw the robe down in the centre
of the yard; if frightened he will not rest until
he has touched it with his nose; he will soon
begin to walk toward the robe and snort, getting
a little closer until he touches it with his nose,
he will see that it will do him no harm, and
finally he will pick it up with his teeth and care
nothing about it. This will show you at once<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
that if you can get him up to the object and let
him feel it with his nose, he will care nothing
about it, and soon forget his scaring, &amp;c.&mdash;When
you try the robe experiment step up to
one side and watch his motions, and he will
soon give you the principle upon which he acts.
The same course must be pursued in breaking
wild colts; go up to it cautiously and by degrees,
never rush up to it all at once; be cautious,
watch the colt, and if you see that he is frightened
at your approach stop a little, and when
he becomes quiet approach a little nearer, and so
on until he will suffer you to touch his face, then
rub him gently the way the hair lays; continue
doing this until he will permit you to feel him
pretty near all over; then place your halter on
him, gently rubbing and feeling him over the
face and head. When you have the halter on
lead him over the yard cautiously; do not
frighten him or whip him. Never whip unless
he is very stubborn and does not fear you, then
you should give him a few sharp cuts with the
whip about his hind legs so as it will crack sharp
and cause him to fear you. After you have
him started feel his face, fore legs, &amp;c. a good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
deal more than you have whipped him, then he
will soon become fond of you again. After you
have learned him to move off, you may put on
the bridle and learn him by gentling him as
you did with the halter; you may now put on
the saddle, but do it cautiously, feeling him by
degrees, then get yourself a block about eighteen
inches high, place this by his side and
when he gets used to this get up on the block,
then put your foot in the stirrup, putting a little
of your weight in it by degrees; as soon as
you find he will bear it you can get on the saddle
and make him move off, but do it all cautiously
so as not to frighten him. When you
have learned him all this you may next put on
the harness, carefully feeling him first, and give
him to understand what you want him to do;
as soon as he finds out you will not hurt him
he will suffer the harness to be put on; now you
may hitch him to a light log, and learn him to
pull this first; when he does this well use a
heavier one, and when he does this all well you
can hitch him up in a wagon or sulky, but do
it all carefully, and do not frighten him or you
may make a bad job of it. The above principle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
should always be carried out in every thing you
wish the horse to learn. You cannot expect a
man to do any piece of work for you unless he
understands it, or has learned the principle of
it, much less can you expect a horse to do something
he knows nothing about. If you pursue
this course you can soon get the horse to understand
what you want him to do, and he will
become very fond of you. I will here state that
if you have a very stubborn colt or horse, you
may use the oil of roses and oil of cummin
with the powdered button, which should be
blown into his nostrils.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span></p>

<h3>HOW TO DRIVE OR BREAK A KICKING
HORSE.</h3>

<p>Or horses with bad habits. First take up one
fore foot, bend his leg till his hoof is bottom upward,
then slip a loop over his knee above the
pastern joint to keep it tight. This should be
done with a leather strap, forming a loop around
the one, and so fixed as to buckle around the
other; be careful so as to fasten it so as it cannot
slip down or come loose, or you may pass a
loop over the leg, and with another strap tie
the loop close together, between the leg, so as
to prevent it from coming down. This will
leave the horse on three legs. You can handle
now as you wish, as it is impossible for him to
kick whilst his leg is up. This will conquer
the horse quicker than any other course
which you can pursue, and especially a kicker
or one that runs off when he has the chance so
to do.</p>

<p>The surest plan for a horse that will attempt
to run off as soon as you hitch him up, is to fasten
up his leg as directed above or learn him to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
hop along on three legs awhile, which he will
soon learn to do. Exercise him two or three
times, in this way fifteen or twenty minutes at
a time, or until conquered, allowing his leg to
be loosed. When you have learned him to walk
in this way, fasten up his leg and put the harness
on him and hitch up to sulky. Now you
may drive off and need not be fearful of the
horse kicking or doing any damage while one
foot is up, nor can he kick or run fast enough to
do any harm. But you can now drive him as
you please. Should he want to run let him
have the lines and whip too, with perfect safety;
by doing this two or three times you will cure
him at once of running off. The horse will be
frightened at first, but he will soon see that you
do not want to hurt him and will not care anything
more about it. You can finally let down
the leg and drive off gently without any further
trouble.</p>

<p>I will here give you another plan to break or
prevent a horse from kicking whilst working
him. Loop a strap or rope around the horse’s
hind leg, with one end and with the other end
fasten around the foreleg, allowing it just long<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
enough for him to make a step, in order to keep
the strap from dragging on the ground or being
in his way while walking. Pass a strap around
his back, letting it pass under his belly and
fasten it up in this way; this properly done will
soon conquer him, as it is impossible for him to
kick whilst the strap is to his legs.</p>

<p>I will still give you another plan to prevent
a horse from kicking. Loop a strap around the
hind leg; let it pass through between the fore
legs, thence through the ring of the bridle bit,
allowing the strap just long enough for him to
make the step, now fasten the strap. You can
now drive off with safety, as it is utterly impossible
for him to kick or to do any harm. You
should pass a strap around the horse’s back and
fasten up the strap or rope to prevent it from
dragging on the ground.</p>

<p>Another still to prevent a horse from kicking
when hitched up in shafts, if he will stand quiet
long enough to fasten in the shafts, when you
have him hitched up, loop a strong strap around
the shaft on the one side, let it pass over the
hips and fasten it to the shaft on the opposite
side; next fasten the strap to the harness at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
top, so as to prevent it from slipping down;
you can now drive off with safety, as far as the
kicking is concerned; for he cannot kick to do
any harm if the strap stays firmly at its place,
and the vehicle heavy enough to prevent him
from raising it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span></p>

<h3>FOR THE BLACKSMITH.</h3>

<p>If you have a horse which you cannot manage
to shoe, take up his leg as directed in the
kicking horse, and handle him awhile, patting
and rubbing all his legs, &amp;c.; when he becomes
quiet, let his leg down to rest; then take it up
again and rub his legs as before, and let him
know what you are about to do to him; then
let his leg down and commence to shoe. Should
he be very fretful yet, and will not suffer you
to put on the shoe, you will meet with success
by making him lay down and perform as directed
in making the horse lay down.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span></p>

<h3>CURE FOR BOTS.</h3>

<p>Mix 1 pint honey with 1 quart sweet milk;
give as a drench; 1 hour after dissolve 1 oz. pulverized
copperas 1 pint of water, use as a drench;
then give 1 quart linseed oil; this cure is said
to be effectual. The principle of giving the
horse the sweet drench is good; it will generally
cause the bots to let loose and take a fill
of the sweet drench; then you should not fail
to give plenty of physic to carry them off.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span></p>

<h3>HOW TO MAKE A HORSE FOLLOW YOU.</h3>

<p>Put your horse into a large stable or small
yard; commence to gentle him a little, take
hold of the halter or bridle, turn him towards
you, touching him with a long whip; at the
same time lead him the length of the stable or
yard, rubbing him on the neck, face and head;
say to him gently as you lead, come along boy,
or better to use his name: whenever you turn,
touch him slightly with the whip, so as to make
him step up close to you; then gentle him again
with your hand as before; he will soon learn to
escape the whip and to be gentled with the hand;
he will soon learn to follow you around without
taking hold of the halter or bridle. Should he
stop or turn from you, give him a few cuts about
the hind legs; he will soon turn his head towards
you, when you must always gentle him with
your hand. A few lessons will make him follow
you or run after you if he sees the motion of the
whip; in a half hour he will follow you about
the stable or yard. After you have given him
3 or 4 lessons in this way, you can take into a
lot and from thence into the road, and he will
follow you any where and run after you.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span></p>

<h3>HOW TO LEARN HIM TO STAND STILL.</h3>

<p>Commence to gentle him with your hand about
the head, &amp;c. Should he move give him a cut
with the whip and put him back in the same
place if he stands; gentle him with the hand as
before, and continue in this until you can get
around him without making him move; continue
walking around him, increasing your walk,
touching him occasionally; enlarging your circle
as you walk around, and if he should move,
give him a cut with the whip and put him again
in his place; if he stands go up to him frequently
and gentle him with your hand; then walk
around him again. Do not keep him in one
position too long at a time; permit him to come
to you and walk him around or about with you;
then stand him at another place, and continue
as before. Do not train him more than half an
hour at a time. You should never attempt to
train a horse to do more than one thing at a
time. Learn him the one which you have commenced
on well first; then in no case should you
attempt to learn him another under a week or
so, always using caution no matter what you
wish him to do or learn.</p>

<h2>A LIST OF MEDICINES BELONGING TO THE HORSE,<br />
<span class="smaller">THEIR PROPERTIES AND USE.</span></h2>

<h3>ANTIMONY.</h3>

<p>A compound of sulphor and antimony is a
good alterative. It is given with sulphor and
nitre in varying quantities.</p>

<h3>SPASMODICS.</h3>

<p>Of these opium stands first on our list, next
peppermint, tincture of pimento, turpentine,
camphor, asafœtida, &amp;c.</p>

<h3>SPIRITS OF CAMPHOR.</h3>

<p>The spirits of camphor is made by taking 95
per cent. alcohol, put in as much gum camphor
as it will dissolve.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span></p>

<h3>VINEGAR.</h3>

<p>Vinegar is a very useful application for sprains,
bruises, &amp;c. Equal parts of boiling water and
cold vinegar will form a good fomentation;
extract of lead or bay salt may be added with
some advantage.</p>

<h3>ALCOHOL&mdash;RECTIFIED SPIRITS.</h3>

<p>This is used in making many tinctures and
other preparations; 3 or 4 ounces of which are
largely diluted with water, and given to a horse
that has become fatigued while on a journey,
will cause him to rally and cheerfully pursue
his course to the end of the day’s travel.</p>

<h3>AQUA-FORTIS.</h3>

<p>This is a valuable external application for
destroying fungus excrescences. A pledget of
tar should be dipped in the acid, then firmly
pressed on the cankerous surface. Every part
with which the acid comes in contact will be
deadened and slough off, when healthy granulations
spring up.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span></p>

<h3>SULPHURIC ACID.</h3>

<p>Sulphuric acid is a good application for the
thrush and canker, and in fact the only thing
that can be relied on. It is occasionally used
with tar in the proportion of an ounce of acid
to 1 pound of tar.</p>

<h3>ALOES.</h3>

<p>The Barbadoes aloes is the best for the horse.
They are of a dark brown color; they are very
useful for physic, and the dose is from ½ to 1
ounce, which should be given immediately in
cases where it is needed. They are also very
useful in the form of a tincture, to make which
8 ounces of powdered aloes and 1 ounce of powdered
myrrh, put into 2 quarts of alcohol diluted
with an equal quantity of water. This mixture
should be well shaken once a day for a
fortnight, and be suffered to stand, in order that
the undissolved portion may fall to the bottom.
This constitutes an excellent application for
wounds, whether recent or of long standing and
indisposed to heal. It is not only a gentle stimulant
but it forms a thin coat over the wound,
and shields it from the action of the air.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span></p>

<h3>ALUM.</h3>

<p>Is occasionally used internally in cases of supurgation,
in the form of alum whey:&mdash;two
drachms of pulverized alum being put into a
pint of hot milk; yet there are much better astringents.
Its principal use is external. A
solution of 2 drachms to a pint of water makes
alone, or with the addition of a small quantity
of white vitriol, a very useful wash for cracked
heels, grease and those forms of swelled legs,
attended with moisture through the skin.</p>

<h3>MURIATIC ACID OR SPIRITS OF SALT.</h3>

<p>This acid is very strong and should be bottled
and corked tight. As soon as it touches any
muscular or living part, a change of color is
perceived. It is good for corns, canker thrush,
and for every case where caustic is needed, this
acid is unrivalled.</p>

<h3>MUSTARD.</h3>

<p>This will be found useful in inflammation of
the chest or bowels. When using, it should be
well rubbed on.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span></p>

<h3>CANTHARIDES.</h3>

<p>Are the basis of the most approved and useful
blister. In blistering, the hair should be cut
or rather shaved off close, then rubbing in the
ointment well for at least 15 minutes, repeating
it every day until it does its work. After it has
acted you may relieve the torture of the animal
by the application of olive oil or lard. In deep
seated sprains or inflammations, the blister
should not be discontinued too hurriedly. An
infusion of 2 ounces of the flies in a pint of oil
of turpentine for several days is used as a liquid
blister, and when sufficiently reduced with common
oil, is called a sweating oil, and gradually
abates or removes old or deep inflammation or
cause of lameness.</p>

<h3>CHARCOAL.</h3>

<p>This is occasionally used with linseed meal,
for poulticing offensive ulcers and cracked heels;
it removes the unwholesome smell and purifies
the parts so that they heal easily.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span></p>

<h3>BALL OR PILLS.</h3>

<p>The usual and most convenient mode of administering
medicines, is in the form of balls
compounded with sweet oil. Balls should never
weigh more than 1½ ounces, otherwise they will
be so large as not to pass down the gullet. They
should not be more than one inch in diameter,
and three inches in length. The mode of delivering
balls is not difficult to acquire. The
horse should be backed in the stall, the tongue
drawn out gently with the left hand on the off
side of the mouth, not continuing to pull, but
by pressing the finger against the lower jaw.
The ball being now taken between the tips of
the fingers of the right hand, is passed rapidly
up the mouth as near the palate as possible, until
it reaches the root of the tongue. It is then
delivered with a slight jerk, the hand being immediately
withdrawn. Its passage should be
watched down the left side of the throat; if it
does not pass down a slight tap under the jaw
or chin, will generally cause the horse to swallow
it, or a few gulps of water will convey in into
the stomach. Very few balls should be kept
made.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span></p>

<h3>CLYSTERS.</h3>

<p>These are useful and too often neglected means
of hastening the bowels to their speedy action,
where diseases require it. The old ox bladder
filled and tied on the wooden or elder pipe, answers
every purpose for injecting the fluid into
the intestines. For a moderate clyster take 2
ounces of soft or yellow soap, mix with 1 gallon
of warm water; for a more active clyster take ½
pound epsom salts, dissolve in the same quantity
of water.</p>

<h3>LINSEED.</h3>

<p>An infusion of linseed is often used instead
of water for the drink of a horse with a sore
throat, catarrh, disease of the urinary organs,
or of the bowels. Thin gruel is preferable,
being as soothing and more nutritious. Linseed
meal makes an excellent poultice for almost any
purpose.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span></p>

<h3>DIGITALIS.</h3>

<p>This should be powdered, put into a black
bottle, corked tight, and kept in a dark place.
It is one of the most valuable medicines in veterinary
practice, and on account of its action in
diminishing the pulse and general irritability
of the system, is very useful in inflammations,
&amp;c. It is usually given in combination with
emetic tartar and nitre. The average dose is 1
drachm of digitalis, 1½ drachms emetic tartar,
and 3 drachms of nitre, repeated twice or three
times a day. When the horse begins to amend
the dose must be diminished one-half, and in a
few days it may be omitted altogether, but the
emetic tartar and the nitre should be continued
during several days.</p>

<h3>PITCH.</h3>

<p>Is used in plasters. The best plaster for sand
crack consists of 1 pound of pitch and 1 ounce
of yellow beeswax melted together.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span></p>

<h3>MASHES.</h3>

<p>Constitute a very important provender in sickness
or health. A mash given occasionally to
a horse that is fed on dry meat, prevents him
from becoming dangerously costive. To the
over-worked and tired horse, nothing is so
refreshing as a warm mash, with his usual
allowance of corn in it. Mashes are used for
putting horses in good order for sale, giving him
a round and plump appearance. They are made
by pouring boiling water on bran, stirring it well;
cover over with a cloth, and let it remain until
cool enough for the horse to eat; if in the heat
of summer, a cold mash is preferable,&mdash;yet it
should be made with hot water, and remain
until it is cold.</p>

<h3>GINGER.</h3>

<p>Is as valuable as a cordial as the gentian is
as a tonic. These are both valuable in horse
powders.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span></p>

<h3>FOMENTATIONS.</h3>

<p>Are to open the pores of the skin and promote
perspiration in the part, so as to abate local
swellings, relieve pain and lessen inflammation.
The effect depends upon the warmth of the water
and not upon any herb that may have been
boiled in it; they are best applied by means of
flannel dipped in the hot water, or on which the
water is poured, which should be as hot as the
hand will bear. The fomentation should be
continued for 15 or 20 minutes, but if kept on
with for half an hour will be better. The parts
fomentated should be wrapped or covered up
warm. Great good has sometimes resulted from
fomentations.</p>

<h3>GENTIAN.</h3>

<p>Stands at the head of vegetable tonics, an
infusion of which is one of the best applications
for putrid ulcers known.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span></p>

<h3>OPIUM.</h3>

<p>Is the most valuable drug on the list as an
anti-spasmodic; it is also a sedative and astringent.
As an anti-spasmodic it enters into the
colic drink; as a sedative it relaxes spasms of
the muscular system. Opium should, however,
be given with caution. In the early acute stage
of fever it will be a bad practice to give it even
in the smallest quantity. When the fever has
passed it may be given with great benefit.</p>

<h3>POULTICES.</h3>

<p>Few persons are aware of the value of these
simple applications in abating inflammation,
relieving pain, cleansing wounds, and disposing
them to heal. In all inflammations of the foot
they are very beneficial, by softening the horn
hardened by the heat of the inflamed foot.&mdash;Linseed
meal forms the best general poultice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span></p>

<h3>DRINKS OR DRENCHES.</h3>

<p>A drink is not so portable as a ball; it is more
troublesome to administer, and a portion of it
is usually wasted. Medicines given as a drench
will act upon the horse much quicker than when
given in balls, but the great objection is in wasting
a portion. Too much of the drink should
not be forced into the horse’s mouth at once, as
it will be found very difficult to make him swallow
large quantities; small portions should be
given, which he should be made to swallow before
any more is put into the mouth.</p>

<h3>TAR.</h3>

<p>Melted with an equal quantity of grease forms
the usual stopping of the farrier. It is warm
or slightly stimulant, and is therefore useful in
dressing bruised or wounded feet; it prevents
the penetration of dirt and water to the wounded
part; it is also useful in chronic coughs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span></p>

<h3>LINIMENTS.</h3>

<p>Are designed to remove deep seated pain and
inflammation, by gently stimulating the skin.
The following is an excellent liniment for old
swellings, sprains, or rheumatism: 2 ounces of
hartshorn, 2 ounces camphorated spirits, 1 ounce
oil of turpentine, and ½ ounce of laudanum,
mixed well together; or 1 ounce of camphor may
be dissolved in 4 ounces of sweet oil, to which
may be added 1 ounce of oil of turpentine. A
little powdered cantharides or tincture of cantharides
or ground mustard, will render either
of these more powerful, or convert it into a
liquid blister.</p>

<h3>SULPHUR.</h3>

<p>Is the basis of the most effectual application
for mange. It is an excellent alterative, combined
usually with antimony and nitre, particularly
for mange, surfeit, grease, hidebound or
want of condition, and it is a useful ingredient in
the cough and fever ball.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span></p>

<h3>COMMON SALT.</h3>

<p>Is very useful in a clyster. A solution of it
has been given as an aperient drink, sprinkled
over hay or in mash, it is very palatable to sick
horses; few things will so soon recall the appetite
as a drink composed of 6 or 8 ounces of
salt in solution. Horses in health, it promotes
the digestion of the food. There are few better
lotions for inflamed eyes than a solution of ½
ounce of salt, in 4 pints of water. An ounce of
salt to 8 pints of water is a good embrocation
for sore shoulders and back.</p>

<h3>TURPENTINE.</h3>

<p>The common liquid turpentine has been described
as one of the best diuretics; for the removal
of colic it stands unrivalled; with cantharides
it is the basis of the sweating blister
for old sprains and swellings.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span></p>

<h3>CHLORIDE OF LIME.</h3>

<p>This is very good for removing the smell of
fistula, withers, poll evil and ill conditioned
wounds and ulcerations. Chloride diluted with
twenty times its quantity of water, and used as
a wash for the wounds, will remove any infection
that may lurk about them. One pint of
the chloride, mixed with 3 gallons of water and
brushed over the walls, manger and rack of the
foulest stable, will completely remove all infections.</p>

<h3>GINGER ROOT.</h3>

<p>This is an excellent stimulant. It is useful
in loss of appetite and flatulent colic, while it
rouses the intestinal canal to its proper action.
The ginger and gentian powdered is also very
much used. Brown sugar is useful in the loss
of appetite.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span></p>

<h3>ZINC OR CALAMINE POWDER.</h3>

<p>This made into an ointment is valuable for
healing. Take five ounces of lard, one ounce
of rosin, melt them together and when these
begin to get cool, stir in 2 ounces of calamine,
finely powdered. If the wound is not healthy,
a small quantity of common turpentine may be
added. This salve justly deserves the name of
healing ointment. The calamine is sometimes
sprinkled with advantage on cracked heels.</p>

<h3>THOMPSON’S NO. 6.</h3>

<p>This is a good carminative for relieving colic,
arresting mortification, and for sprains, rheumatism,
pains, &amp;c. As a general stimulant it
may be taken in teaspoonful doses in water and
repeated as the case demands. Take ½ gallon
of fourth proof brandy, ½ pound pulverized gum
myrrh and ½ ounce of African pepper, mix and
macerate for ten days, when it will be ready for
use.</p>

<h3>CEMENT TO MEND GLASS AND CHINA.</h3>

<p>Take 2 pounds good gum, shellac, 2 ounces
pulverized borax; put into an earthen crock,
filled half full of water; boil until all is dissolved,
then take out a portion and roll into
sticks while hot, on a table or smooth board.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Directions for Use.</span></h4>

<p>Heat the edges of the ware over a fire or hot
stove, then heat the cement in the same manner;
put the cement on the edges of the ware regularly,
heat it again along the edges and place
together as quick as possible, holding them firm
until the cement cools, being careful to put the
pieces together as they came off, so as it will fit
nicely. If done properly it will hold so firm
that the ware will break some other place before
where it has been mended.</p>

<h3>LUNAR CAUSTIC.</h3>

<p>Is very useful in curing bites of rabid dogs,
and for removing ulcerations of any kind.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span></p>

<h3>AMERICAN HELEBORE.</h3>

<h4><i>Medical Properties and Use.</i></h4>

<p>This has been tried by many physicians and
has proved a valuable remedy in chronic rheumatism
and gout. It is certainly a powerful
emetic when given in large doses, and the effect
continues a long time. In over doses it effects
the functions of the brain and nervous system,
in a powerful manner producing giddiness, prostration
of strength, &amp;c. It has arrested the
paroxysm of gout and given relief in some unyielding
cases of chronic rheumatism. It requires
to be given with great caution and under
vigilant restrictions. The mode of administration
is in the form of a tincture. A saturated
tincture is made in wine and 3 parts of this is
mixed with 1 of the wine of opium; of this
mixture from 15 to 20 drops. In some cases
however, 1 drachm of the mixture will be required
to give relief, which quantity generally
vomits and always gives relief. The proper
method of preparing this tincture is to macerate
8 ounces of the sliced root in 2½ pints of spanish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
white wine, let it stand for 15 days and
filter. Before given, it must be mixed with one-fourth
its quantity of the wine of opium; from
15 to 60 drops is a dose. In some cases less
than the nauseating point will cure the disease,
if not it must be carried to that point.</p>

<h3>EMETIC FOR POISON.</h3>

<p>If poison should be administered or swallowed
accidentally, take two tablespoonsful of ground
mustard, mixed with warm water, which will
operate as an instantaneous emetic.</p>

<h3>INDIAN TURNIP.</h3>

<h4><i>Medical Properties and use.</i></h4>

<p>The Indian turnip, when partially dried and
grated and mixed with honey, is good for the
coughs of old persons, when there is no fever.
It also enters into many of the cough syrups.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span></p>

<h3>SENECA SNAKEROOT.</h3>

<p>In chronic rheumatism it has been of great
service by its universal stimulant and diuretic
effects. If however an ounce of the root be boiled
in a pint of water to a strong tea, and all be
taken at once, a violent vomiting, purging and
diuresis occurs. The disease has been known
to yield to one dose, but this is a desperate one,
and should not be ventured upon by a person
much debilitated; take a wine glass full 3 times
until the water is evacuated in uterine complaints,&mdash;especially
in painful menstruation is
the seneca a good remedy. Begin one day before
the return of the catatmenia and take it in
such portions as the stomach will bear, every
two hours until the flow commences. For this
put 1 ounce of the root in a pint of water, give
a small wine glass full every one, two or three
hours.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span></p>

<h3>CEMENT FOR GRAFTING.</h3>

<p>Take 1 pound of beeswax, 1 pound of rosin,
1 pound of tallow; put all into a pan and heat
until the ingredients are melted, after cooling it
will be ready for use. When using put a coat
of the cement over the grafted part, thick enough
to prevent the rain and air from penetrating.</p>

<h3>GUAIACUM, AMMONIATED TINCTURE.</h3>

<p>Take 4 ounces powdered gum guaiacum, 1½
pints spirits of amonia, put them together and
let the mixture stand for fourteen days, when it
will be ready for use. Shake the bottle occasionally.
This is a celebrated remedy in the
treatment of chronic rheumatism. The dose is
from one to two teaspoonsful three times a day,
given in milk or some mucilaginous tea. The
stomach must be well cleaned before the tincture
is used, and the diet light.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span></p>

<h3>COMPOUND TINCTURE OF GENTIAN.</h3>

<p>Take of gentian root bruised 2 ounces, orange
peel do. 2 ounces, cardamom seed do. ½ ounce,
proof whiskey 1 quart; add the other ingredients
to the whiskey, and shake the bottle once
a day for fourteen days, when it will be ready
for use. This is much used in dyspepsia and
debilitated states of the digestive organs. The
stomach should be cleaned before it is given.
It is not admissable where there is fever. Dose
from one to two teaspoonsful in water, to be repeated
before breakfast, dinner and supper.</p>

<h3>OINTMENT FOR MILCH SCALD ON THE
FACES OF INFANTS.</h3>

<p>Take 6 drachms of beefs marrow, 2 drachms
oil of sweet almonds, 1 drachm red peruvian
bark, powdered, mix and melt over a slow fire.
Apply every day, washing it off every morning
with mild soap.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span></p>

<h3>SIMPLE TINCTURE OF RHUBARB.</h3>

<p>Take of best Turkey rhubarb 3 ounces and
pulverize, good whiskey 1 quart, add the rhubarb
to the whiskey and shake it every day for
a week, then let it stand ten days and filter
through paper, or let it stand without filtering.
From a tea spoonful to a large table spoonful is
a dose according to the age of the person and
nature of the case. It is a good purgative in
costive habits. Take it at bed time in sweetened
water.</p>

<h3>SIMPLE SYRUP OF RHUBARB.</h3>

<p>Take of best Turkey rhubarb 2 ounces, water
1 pint, macerate the rhubarb in the water warm
for twenty-four hours; strain off, add 2 pounds
of refined white sugar and simmer until they
are well mixed, add 2 tablespoonsful of whiskey,
stop it tight in a bottle for use. This is a good
medicine for infants in teaspoonful doses.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span></p>

<h3>AMERICAN COLUMBO.</h3>

<h4><i>Medical Properties and Use.</i></h4>

<p>This is a mild tonic, calculated to meet the
indications alike with the other bitters of its
class. It is a very good and pleasant tonic in
indigestion and dyspepsia, improving the appetite
and digestion. It is given in infusion and
in substance&mdash;1 ounce of the pulverized root infused
in a pint of boiling water. A small wine
glass full of the infusion may be taken once in
2 hours, or from thirty to sixty grains of the
pulverized substance, in sweetened water, from
3 to 5 times a day; but the most common way
of using the columbo is in combination with
other tonics, such as gentian, orange peel, and
columbo, of each 1 ounce powdered, then add
to them 1 quart of whiskey, of which bitters a
tablespoonful may be taken in water three
times a day, as a tonic in cases of debility.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span></p>

<h3>BLACK ALDER.</h3>

<p>The berries of this plant are sometimes used,
but the bark is the proper medicinal part of the
shrub. It is best adapted to the cure of flabby,
ill-conditioned ulcers and mortifications, in
which a strong decoction is freely used with
great benefit. It should be given internally
several times a day, as well as applied as a wash
and poultice to the parts. A saturated tincture,
both of the bark and berries is used internally.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span></p>

<h3>THE PRICKLEY ASH.</h3>

<h4><i>Its Medical Properties and Use.</i></h4>

<p>The prickley ash has a good reputation in the
United States as a remedy in chronic rheumatism.
In that disease its operation seems analogous
to that of mazorion and guaiacum, which
it nearly resembles in its sensible properties.
Many physicians place so much confidence in it
that it is generally kept by the apothecaries.
It is most frequently given in decoction&mdash;an
ounce being boiled in a quart of water and
taken in small quantities, frequently repeated.
Dr. George Hayward, of Boston, took it in his
own case of chronic rheumatism with evidently
good effect; he took a pint of the decoction a
day, diluted with water so as to weaken its pungency.
The powdered bark may be taken in
doses of from 10 to 20 grains, and frequently
repeated. Dr. Bigelow says it is also given with
good effect in cases of old indolent sores; it is
given internally and applied to the sore in the
form of a wash. Doctors Barton and Thatcher
both speak highly of this medicine.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span></p>

<h3>AMERICAN GENTRAURY.</h3>

<h4><i>Its Medical Properties and Use.</i></h4>

<p>Every part of this plant is a pure and very
strong bitter. It is used in form of tea or tincture
and is good for ague and fever. It was
used in the yellow fever at Philadelphia with
good effect. It may be given even when the
fever is on, in such quantities as the stomach
will bear. It is not apt to nauseate and is an
excellent tonic for the stomach, which improves
the appetite and promotes digestion. It is highly
recommended by Drs. Barton, Chapman and
Elliott, all of whom are physicians of high respectability.</p>

<h3>DANDELINE.</h3>

<p>Has been much employed in Germany and
the United States, and is certainly a valuable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
remedy in chronic diseases of the liver and the
digestive organs generally. It is also a good
remedy in diseases of the spleen. It is beneficial
in consumption and as a general alterative
when combined with sarsaparilla, and invaluable
in scrofula. One ounce of the fresh root,
or ½ ounce of the dried, and the same quantity of
sarsaparilla put into a pitcher and a pint of
boiling water poured on it at night, to be used
at pleasure next day, so that all is taken before
bed time, or as much more as the stomach will
bear. This repeated for a month, produces a
fine effect on the system, when the blood needs
purifying or in cases of chronic affections of
the liver.</p>

<h3>BLOOD ROOT OR PERCOON ROOT.</h3>

<h4><i>Medical Properties and Use.</i></h4>

<p>The blood root is an active emetic and cathartic,
which acts finely on the liver. It has been
given in pneumonia, catarrh, whooping cough,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
croup, consumption, rheumatism, jaundice and
dropsy of the chest. For rheumatism, it may
be given in 2 or 3 grain pills, 3 or 4 times a
day. It is an effectual remedy for the yellow
water in horses: 3 or 4 ounces of the fresh root
may be bruised and a pint of water added, the
juice of which should be squeezed out for a
drench; 1 or 2 doses will cure. It purges the
horse freely. The tincture is often used: 2
ounces of the root to a quart of spirits makes
the tincture, ½ an ounce of which is a dose for
an adult.</p>

<h3>BONESET OR THOROUGHWORT.</h3>

<h4><i>Medical Properties and Use.</i></h4>

<p>Thoroughwort is tonic, diaphoretic, and in
large doses emetic and purgative. It is good in
intermittent fevers to break the chill, if given in
large doses in the form of warm tea as the chill
comes on; in less doses a little warm it will
sweat the patient freely; in large draughts taken<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
cold it acts as a tonic and prevents the return of
the chill. It is good in pleurisy as a sweat or
in heavy colds; it is also good when made into
a syrup for bad coughs, and in some forms of
consumption, where the patient is weak and the
skin hot and dry. It grows in almost every
part of the United States, but mostly in the
Western and Southern divisions, and should be
gathered in September. Every part of the plant
is medicinal, but the leaves and flowers are best.
It should always be given in the form of a tea.</p>

<h3>BITTER ROOT OR SILKWEED.</h3>

<h4><i>Medical Properties and Use.</i></h4>

<p>The root is the part used in the form of bitters
in asthma and catarrh, also coughs and
dyspepsia and in rheumatism. It may be taken
in the form of bitters in quantities sufficient to
purge gently and freely, or in powder in 20
grain doses, 3 times a day, or it may be given
in strong infusion, 1 ounce of the root to a pint
of water and drink in such doses as the stomach
will bear.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span></p>

<h3>PLEURISY ROOT.</h3>

<h4><i>Medical Properties and Use.</i></h4>

<p>It has long been employed by the regular medical
faculty as a valuable medicine in pleurisy,
catarrh, pneumonia, consumption and other diseases
of the breast, and is evidently useful in all
these cases. It is good in acute rheumatism and
dyspepsia. It may be given in the form of a
strong tea, or in powder; if in powder from 20
to 60 grains may be given several times a day,
in sweetened water.</p>

<h3>EXTEMPORE GASEOUS CHALYBEATE
WATER.</h3>

<p>Take of pure sulphate of iron 2 drachms,
white sugar 3 drachms, pulverize, mix and divide
into 12 powders. Then take of super carbonate
of soda 2 drachms, white sugar three
drachms, mix and divide into 12 powders. Mix
one of each of the powders separately in half a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
tumblerful of water, pour together and drink
while effervescing. This is a pleasant drink and
a good tonic for a weak stomach.</p>

<h3>GENTIAN.</h3>

<h4><i>Medical Properties and Use.</i></h4>

<p>Gentian possesses in a high degree the tonic
properties which characterize the simple bitters.
It excites the appetite, invigorates the powers
of digestion. It may be used in all cases of
disease depending upon pure debility of the
digestive organs, or requiring a general tonic
impression; as dyspepsia, gout, difficult menstruations,
hysteria, scrofula, intermittent fever,
diarrhœa, and worms. It is given in the form
of infusion or tincture. The dose in infusion is
a wine glassful 3 or 4 times a day. Infuse ½
ounce of the powdered root in a pint of water.
A tea spoonful of the tincture may be given as
often in a little water.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span></p>

<h3>RATTLEWEED ROOT.</h3>

<p>This unites with a tonic power the property
of stimulating the secretions, particularly those
of the skin, kidneys and mucus membrane of
the lungs. Its medical properties are found in
its salutary effects upon the nervous system, in
neuralgia of the heart, in sciatica, and in other
forms of rheumatism. It is equal if not superior
to the colchicum in rheumatism, and far
superior to it in neuralgia of any description.
I have used it extensively in those cases, and
with the happiest effects. I cured myself of a
severe sciatica in twenty-four hours with it, but
the dose was too large, producing violent sickness,
great prostration, nausea, vomiting and
profuse perspiration. I took 3 or 4 drachms of
the saturated tincture at one dose; but it effects
the cure completely when properly prepared.
It acts upon the stomach and bowels powerfully,
and its full effects are not obtained until it
purges freely. The following is the best formula
for its preparation.</p>

<ul>
<li>½ pound powdered root,</li>
<li>1 pint alcohol.</li>
</ul>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span></p>

<p>Mix and macerate for 20 days and filter. One
tea spoonful should be taken 3 times a day, in
sweetened water, which may be increased or
diminished so as to produce 3 or 4 operations on
the bowels in 24 hours. I have seen some persons
that it would not purge. It sometimes
produces vertigo before it begins to operate, but
these symptoms will all subside after the purging
commences, yet it will cure if it does not
purge. Several cases of Vitus’ Dance are recorded
by Dr. Jesse Young, in which it performed
cures after other remedies had failed.&mdash;It
is usually administered in decoction by those
living in the country. One ounce of the powdered
root is boiled in a pint of water for a few
minutes, and a small wine glassful given from
3 to 5 times a day according to its effects.</p>

<h3>PIPSISSEWAY OR WINTER GREEN.</h3>

<p>This is an evergreen found in pine woods and
in light shady soils in all parts of the United
States, which blossoms in mid summer. The
whole plant has rather a pungent and bitter
taste.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span></p>

<h4><i>Medical Properties and Use.</i></h4>

<p>It is diuretic and tonic and is useful in all
eruptive forms of diseases, especially in scrofula
and cancer. A strong decoction may be made
of the leaves and twigs, and a gill taken 3 times
a day. Many cures of old ulcers, sore throats
and like affections have been ascribed to the use
of the pipsisseway. A decoction made of the
leaves and given in small portions is excellent
for colic in children. For grown persons it
should be put in good rye whiskey, which, if
made strong will seldom fail to cure the severest
cases of colic and cramps. The pipsisseway put
into whiskey and distilled the same as Wickey’s
cholera medicine is much better. Dose for an
adult is from 1 to 3 tablespoonsful, for children
from 10 drops to a teaspoonful.</p>

<h3>TO THE CONSUMER.</h3>

<p>If you want to save money never buy your
castor oil by the bottle, but buy a pint of oil of
some honest druggist, and you will then be able
to perceive the difference. If put up in bottles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
it will cost you from 50 to 62½ cents; by the
pint it may cost you 31 cents per pint. This is
a great saving, as the article is always needed
in a family. Never buy any other medicine or
any thing that goes by measurement in small
quantities, and especially such articles as come
into every day use. Paying from 40 to 100 per
cent. more for domestic articles will amount to a
considerable sum in 5 or 10 years. Some persons
may say: “I am too poor and cannot spare
the money.” That kind of argument will not
hold good. By saving 50 or 100 per cent. is
the means to make you able. Try the experiment
and you will soon be convinced; money is
worth but 6 per cent.</p>

<h3>FOR PICKLING PEARS.</h3>

<p>Take 1 pound of sugar to one quart of vinegar;
6 pounds of pears, peeled and quartered; ½
ounce of cinnamon bark, broken in small pieces;
½ ounce of cloves. Dissolve the sugar in the
vinegar, then put the pears, cinnamon and cloves
into a pot or crock, pour over the vinegar and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
boil all together until the pears become soft, and
you have a pickel far superior to any preserves.
This is worth giving a trial. Should the pears
be too sweet, add a little vinegar at any time,
heating after the addition.</p>

<h3>ON THE PRESERVATION OF HEALTH.</h3>

<p>As this work is designed for the benefit of
families as well as other purposes, it is hoped
that a chapter on the preservation of the health
of young girls will not be out of place. What
we design to say in this chapter, will be applicable
to the girl of ten years and upwards. It
is the duty of the mother or guardian so to direct
the conduct of the daughter that she may
enjoy the blessings of life, and become a useful
member of society. But in order to lay the
foundation of future usefulness, the health
should be well guarded in early life. Much of
course depends upon a good constitution, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
strict attention should be paid to its development
and preservation. The child at an early
age should be guarded against all that would
tend to weaken or derange this desirable attribute
of the human system.</p>

<p>Exposure is one of the principal sources of
injury to the constitution, and therefore the
clothing should always be adapted to the season
of the year, and the temperature of the air,
whether children are at home or abroad. Girls
are generally clothed sufficiently warm while at
home, but when they are going from home, they
change their warm apparel for thinner and cooler
garments. They are often allowed to expose
themselves to the chilling blasts of winter, with
their arms naked, their breasts and shoulders
exposed, and their feet clad with thin stockings
and shoes, in the place of those just laid
aside, which were warm and comfortable.&mdash;This
is a practice that cannot be too much
deprecated, being one of the great evils of dress
and fashion, upon whose altar thousands have
been sacrificed. How many do we find in these
days with enlarged tonsils and broken croaking
voices, the fruits of exposure and nothing else?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span></p>

<p>The practice of tight lacing is another fruitful
cause of destruction of health and broken-down
constitutions. Young girls should not
lace at all&mdash;an easy smooth jacket to make the
dress fit smoothly is all they should wear. Are
we asked why lacing is injurious? We answer,
first, the ribs are soft and very elastic and the
cartilages that join them to the breast bone are
softer than the ribs. If then a jacket or corset
be laced around the ribs or chest, so as to prevent
a free and full play of the ribs at every inspiration,
in the same proportion is the cavity
of the chest diminished, and consequently the
lungs are deprived of a certain amount of atmospheric
air, in proportion to the contraction
of the ribs, produced by the laced jacket or corset.
Thus the order of nature is deranged and
the system is deprived of that due proportion of
oxygen which is necessary to health, the vitality
of blood and the vigor and proper proportions
of the system. One of the consequences of tight
lacing therefore is, that the lungs are prevented
from discharging a due portion of carbonic acid
gas from the blood, and receiving in lieu therefor
of due proportion of oxygen from the atmosphere.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
Hence the person looks pale, the lips
assume a blue or purplish color, the breathing is
labored, the breast heaves and the circulation
is prevented from going on as freely as it should.
The small air vessels of the lungs are partially
obliterated, they become diseased in their action
and tubercles form in them or the lungs; these
remain to become in a few years the seeds of an
incurable consumption.</p>

<p>Again: The free action of the heat is prevented
by tight lacing and the consequence is it
labors like a dying man, but in vain&mdash;it cannot
get relieved from its fetters. The blood is prevented
from flowing with that freedom and ease
which are essential to the well being of the system,
and the violent exertions which the heart
must make in order to carry on the circulation,
become the cause of disease in that organ, which
perhaps can never be cured. Another evil of
lacing: The stomach is always included in the
deadly grasp of the corset. The lower floating
ribs are forced to take the place the stomach
should occupy in part; the skirts are compelled
to grow too narrow, the liver is also pressed too
closely and the stomach is bound as with a cord.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
The gastric juice is partly prevented from secreting
and that which is secreted is unhealthy, the
ducts of the liver and pancreatic gland are prevented
from performing their healthy functions
and consequently the food is not taken in due
quantity to nourish the system, and what is
taken is not properly digested, for the want of
a free and healthy action of the digestive functions.
Dyspepsia is the result,&mdash;a feeble and
finally a destroyed constitution. For all the
powers of nature must act freely and naturally,
or a sound constitution and good health can
never be enjoyed.</p>

<p>Nothing is so fascinating to an intellectual
young man as a well cultivated mind, a rosy
cheek, an intellectual eye, and a corresponding
expression of countenance; these you cannot
have if you suppress any of the healthy functions
of the system. Exercise is another essential
item to promote the health of girls, and
this they should be allowed to take freely. At
an early age, let them run and play, jump the
rope, throw the hoop, leap and skip; for free
exercise gives freedom to the muscles and joints
and strengthens the nerves, all of which are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
necessary for the building up of a good constitution.
Girls should be allowed to sleep one-third
of their time or eight hours in twenty-four,
and when younger&mdash;they should sleep more.
The young of all the animal creation require
more sleep than those that are fully grown:
girls, therefore, should retire early that they
may obtain sleep enough; rise early and enjoy
the benefit of the morning air, which is bracing
to their systems. After children are ten years
old, they should not sleep more than two in a
bed, and there should not be more than two beds
in a room, unless the room be very large and
well ventilated. Girls should rise early and
air and set their rooms in order; they should
use free ablution of cold water over their breasts
and arms, especially as far as they are in the
habit of exposing them to the air, as this will
prevent their taking cold as easily as they otherwise
would. The diet of children should be
plain and simple, as their digestive powers are
not as strong as those of grown persons. The
quantity should always be proportioned to the
age and strength of the child. Much mischief
is done by letting children eat too much. They<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
should be allowed full time to eat and be taught
to chew their victuals well. They should be
taught to eat any thing that is common, so that
they may appear easy at table at all times, and
make their friends so likewise. Frequent bathing
is of great service to youth; it invigorates
the constitution and gives a fine complexion.
The bath may be changed according to the season;
it may be cold, tepid or salt. When the
cold bath is used, either fresh or salt, the skin
should be well rubbed with a coarse towel, as
well before they go into the bath, as after they
come out. When children are healthy liquid
food is as a general rule, better for them than
solid food, because it supplies more blood, and
this is needed to form and build up the solids,
but they should be allowed some of both.</p>

<p>Children should always take light suppers
and light breakfasts. Their dinner should be of
more substantial food and taken freely. But
they should never be allowed to eat in haste, as
nothing aids the powers of digestion more than
the perfect mastication of food.</p>

<h3>HEALTH.<br />
<span class="smcap">Its Value, Conditions, Preservation and Restoration.</span></h3>

<p>Health consists in the vigorous and normal
or constitutional action of all the physical organs
and functions. Life consists in precisely
the same action: in proportion to the vigor of
this action is the amount of both health and life,
but in proportion as the physical functions are
enfeebled or diseased, is health enfeebled and
life diminished. But in proportion as we improve
our health do we thereby increase life
itself. Viewed in any and every aspect, health
is life and life is health. By as much therefore
as life is valuable should health be preserved if
good and restored if feeble.</p>

<p>Health is the great seasoner or relish of all
our blessings; nor is it possible to enjoy the latter
except by means of the former: without
health what can we be? What can we do?&mdash;What
can we enjoy? For other things being
equal, our capabilities of accomplishing and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
enjoying are proportioned to our health and
diminished by disease. If we possessed all the
wealth, and all the honors, and all the blessings
mortals can possess, we could enjoy them only
in proportion as we had health, and their value
would be diminished just in proportion to its
decline. Suppose we were sick and our appetite
thereby destroyed, the richest food and most
delicious fruits, instead of rendering us happy
would nauseate us. How different if we were
healthy. How a good appetite, the produce of
health, would enjoy them. Well might the
glutted alderman offer a ragged boy a guinea
for his appetite for breakfast. The rich invalid
is poor, but he who is healthy is rich, because
his fund of life and his capacities for enjoyment
are proportionally great. Reader, if brought
to the brink of the grave, your last hour come,
what would you give? What that you possessed
would you not give for another year of life and
its pleasures? Astor’s thirty millions would be
cheap. To impair health in obtaining any
amount of earthly goods is a dear exchange,
since then to preserve or regain health is to preserve,
prolong or regain life itself, and to impair<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
the former is to destroy the latter and its pleasures,
as well as hasten death; and since the
value of life so infinitely surpasses that of all
other earthly blessings, what consummate folly to
trifle with health on any account. Then how
much more foolish and even wicked virtually to
throw it away for nothing, in our eager pursuit
of those trifling objects, wealth, honors, and the
like, which mainly engrosses mankind? What,
sacrifice life upon the altar of mammon? For
be it remembered, that no human being can impair
his health at any period of his life, without
proportionally shortening his days; without
being brought to a strict account at the close of
life, and he compelled to end it as much sooner
than he otherwise would, as he has injured his
health during his whole lifetime. Let me urge
upon you the infinite importance of preserving
your health. This effectually done, millions of
money bestowed on each reader could not equally
benefit you, because of the incomparable greater
value of health than money. Let your own experience
testify. Which of you has not, some
time or some how, induced debility or pain in
one portion of your system or another, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
will cripple you for life. A foolish ambition
breaks down the constitution of an incalculable
number of our youths, unwilling to be outdone
they will work at the top of their strength as
long as they can stand, perhaps over heat themselves,
or in a single day or week bring on some
complaint which debilitates them for life, and
carries them to a premature grave. An ambitious
youth wishing to show his employers what
a great day’s work he could do, shovelled till he
lamed his side, so that for fifteen years he has
been a partial invalid, cannot do any kind of
work, nor more than half the amount he formerly
did, besides working in almost perpetual
pain. Nor is this the half; whatever enfeebles
the health enfeebles the mind by weakening and
disordering the brain. So perfectly are body
and brain inter related, that all the conditions
of either react upon each other; whatever augments
the health, strengthens the body and
thereby invigorates both the brain and the mind.
What is the true value of the mind? How much
could you afford to give for double the amount
you now possess? Neither money nor any thing
else can measure its value. To improve our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
minds is the most effectual mode possible of
augmenting all the capabilities, all the pleasure,
all the virtue of this life, and ripening for
another, and hence should be the paramount
business of our whole lives. Health allows you
to be always on hand for business, from which
sickness takes you and compels you to entrust
its management to others, always disastrous, or
cuts off your wages if a laborer, creates large
doctors, nurses and a host of other incidental
bills, and occasions a great variety of pecuniary
losses. So measurably if any member of your
family is sick, especially a wife. How many,
reader, if they and their families had always
been well, would have been rich who are now
poor? Considered which ever way you will, to
preserve the health if it be good, and if poor
to regain and then preserve, should be the paramount
business of life, should take precedence
over all others, and be our first great concern.
Come then readers one and all and let us make it
our permanent business to preserve and augment
our health; let us allow ourselves to do nothing
that shall impair it; let us make and take time
to do every thing in our power to invigorate it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span></p>

<h3>HOW TO PROLONG LIFE.</h3>

<p>The following should be carefully perused
especially by the young. Are there any among
you my young friends, who desire to preserve
your health and cheerfulness through life, and
at length arrive at a good old age? If so listen
to what I am about to tell you.</p>

<p>A considerable time ago I read in one of the
newspapers of the day, that a man had died near
London at the advanced age of 110 years, that
he had never been ill, and that he had maintained
through life, a cheerful, happy temperament.
I wrote immediately to London to
know if in the man’s treatment of himself there
had been any peculiarity which had rendered
his life lengthened and so happy, and the answer
I received was as follows:</p>

<p>“He was unusually kind and obliging to every
body; he quarreled with no one; he ate and drank
merely that he might not suffer from hunger or
thirst and never beyond what necessity required;
from his earliest youth he never allowed himself
to be unemployed; these were the only means
he used.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span></p>

<p>I took a note of this in a little book where I
generally write all that I am anxious to remember,
and very soon afterwards I observed in
another paper that a woman had died near
Stockholm at 115 years of age; that she never
was ill, and was always of a contented disposition.
I immediately wrote to Stockholm to
learn what means the old woman had used for
preserving her health, and now read the answer:</p>

<p>“She always had a great love of cleanliness,
and in the daily habit of washing her face,
hands and feet in cold water, and as often as
opportunity offered she bathed in the same.&mdash;She
never ate or drank any delicacies or sweet-meats,
seldom coffee, seldom tea, and never wine.”</p>

<p>Of these likewise I took a note in my little
book. Sometime after this I read that near St.
Petersburg, a man died who had enjoyed good
health until he was 120 years old. Again I
took my pen and wrote to St. Petersburg, and
here is the answer:</p>

<p>“He was an early riser, and never slept beyond
seven hours at a time; he never was idle;
he employed himself chiefly in the open air, and
particularly in his garden; whether he walked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
or sat in his chair he never permitted himself
to sit awry or in a bent posture, but was always
perfectly straight. The luxurious and effeminate
habits of citizens he held in contempt.”</p>

<p>After having read all this from my little book
I said to myself: “you will be a foolish man
indeed not to profit by the example and experience
of these old people.” I then wrote out all
that I had been able to discover about these
happy old people upon a card, which I suspended
over my writing desk, so that I might always
have it before my eyes to remind me what to do,
and from what I should refrain. Every morning
and evening I read over the contents of my
card and obliged myself to conform to its rules.</p>

<p>And now my dear young readers, I can assure
you on the word of an honest man, that I am
much happier and in better health than I used
to be. Formerly I had the headache every day
and now I suffer scarcely once in three or four
months. Before I began these rules I hardly
dare to venture out in the rain or snow without
catching cold. In former times a walk of half
an hour’s length fatigued and exhausted me, now
I walk miles without weariness. Imagine then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
the happiness I experience, for there are few
feelings so cheering to the spirits as those of
constant good health and vigor. But, alas! there
is something in which I cannot imitate these
happy old people, and that is I have not been
accustomed to all this from my youth. Oh! that
I were young again that I might imitate them
in all things; that I might be happy and long-lived
as they were.</p>

<p>Little children who read this, you are the
fortunate ones who are able to adopt in perfection
this kind of life. What then prevents
your living henceforward as healthful and happily
as the old woman of Stockholm or as long
and useful as the old men of London and St.
Petersburg.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span></p>

<h3>LIQUID OPODELDOC.</h3>

<p>Take ½ pint 95 per cent. alcohol, 1 ounce
camphor, ½ pint turpentine; dissolve the camphor
in the alcohol; then add the turpentine.
For rheumatism, head ache, sore throat, old
strains, swellings, cramps, numbness, stiffness,
weakness, pains in the joints, corns, slight burns,
frost bitten feet, &amp;c.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Directions for Use.</span></h4>

<p>Rub it well on the part affected with your
hand or a piece of muslin, night and morning,
and if convenient, at noon. In obstinate cases
avoid as much as possible exposure to a damp
atmosphere, to the extremes of heat and cold.
Keep the feet dry and comfortable, and be temperate
in eating and drinking. For corns, lay
a piece of flannel on them and moisten occasionally
with the opodeldoc, avoid tight shoes.
Travellers and families ought always to keep
a bottle by them; it only requires a trial to
prove its efficacy; keep the bottle closely stopped.
In some cases of rheumatism and other
affections, if a piece of flannel be worn over the
part, relief will be obtained sooner.</p>

<p>Pulverize these as fine as possible, put them
into one gallon of French brandy of the best
quality, or best fourth-proof old rye whiskey;
brandy is best&mdash;put the whole into a bottle or
jar&mdash;a bottle is best if one can be had large
enough at the top, which must be closed; then
place the bottle or jar in the sand, which should
be at least two inches deep at the bottom of the
kettle or crock; fill in sand to come above the
drugs when settled, and put under it a slow fire,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
so as to keep it warm but not to boil. Let it digest
for fourteen days and filter the whole of it
through fine flannel several times, so as to separate
the drugs well; then put in each gallon
2 ounces spirits of camphor and 2 ounces spirits
saffron, when it will be ready for use.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Directions for Use.</span></h4>

<p>For preventing cholera: first take one tablespoonful
in the morning, fasting on cold water,
one at noon, and one at night. Second, for an
attack or symptoms take from 2 to 3 tablespoonsful
every 5, 10 or 15 minutes, as the case may
require, until relieved, when the doses may be
lessened, or not so often. Let the patient go to
bed and keep warm and quiet as possible until
relieved. Third, for the third stage or relapse,
vomiting and pain in the stomach, take from 2
to 4 tablespoonsful every 5 or 10 minutes, as the
case may be, until relieved or thrown into a
sweat; cover up warm, and if cold apply plenty
of hot bricks or bottles with hot water in, to
the feet, hands, body, &amp;c. mustard plaster on
the stomach, rubbing with the hand, some stimulant,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
as not a moment’s time should be lost
when the cold chill comes on. Fourth stage
or relapse, attended with cold sweats and rice
water discharges, take large doses every 3 or 5
minutes; continue until the patient becomes
warm and easier. No time should be lost at
this stage of the disease. Apply hot bricks,
bottles, &amp;c. as before directed; when relieved the
doses may be less and not so often&mdash;say from ½
hour to 6 hours; continue 3 or 4 days as the case
may require, and do not fail to keep the patient
warm, &amp;c.</p>

<p>For bilious or cramp colic, cholera morbus,
flux, bilious fever, &amp;c. administer doses as above.
Let the patient go to bed and keep as quiet
as possible until relieved. In severe cases of
cholera morbus, a mustard plaster should be
placed over the stomach, which must be kept on
as long as it can be borne. Travellers and families
should not be without this medicine, as it
as considered by all who have used it to be the
safest and surest remedy for the above disease
ever introduced. Take a friend’s advice and
never be without this remedy, as it was never
known to fail in curing what it is recommended<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
to do. Give it a fair trial, and its efficacy will
soon be seen. By strictly obeying the directions
it is perfectly safe and harmless; it is also
good in sick stomachs, &amp;c.</p>

<p>This medicine, when persevered in according
to directions, will effectually cure cholera in all
its stages, and all that it is recommended to do,
which can be attested by certificates from many
persons. By adding the tincture of cayenne you
will find this medicine effectual in cramp colic;
add the tincture until as strong as it can be
taken.</p>

<p>To be more plain and simple,&mdash;in making of
the cholera medicine, if in the summer you can
set the bottle or jar in the sun, which should be
when the sun is very warm, letting it remain
some 3 or 4 weeks&mdash;the longer you distil, the
better the medicine. If in the winter season,
you can place your crock on the top of the stove,
keeping the fire regular, so as not to boil&mdash;if
you distil until reduced one-third, it will be
much stronger and better.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span></p>

<h3>CERTAIN REMEDY FOR RHEUMATISM.</h3>

<p>Take of sarsaparilla root, coltsfoot root, or
wild ginger root, sassafras root, dogwood root,
yellow poplar root, prickley ash root, spicewood
root, one handful of each, when dried, as much
as you can hold in one hand; cut the bark off of
the roots and pulverize as fine as you can, except
the sarsaparilla, which must be cut in very
small pieces; then put the whole in one gallon
of best fourth-proof old rye whiskey, and let it
stand for 1 or 2 weeks; but should you wish to
use immediately, set the vessel containing the
ingredients on the stove, and keep just warm for
2 or 3 days, when it will be fit for use.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Directions for Use.</span></h4>

<p>Take from 1 to 3 tablespoonsful 3 times a day,
one hour before meals. It may be taken 5 or 6
times a day provided it does not affect the nerves
too much. It is perfectly safe and has cured
more cases of rheumatism than any other remedy
introduced.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span></p>

<p>I will cite one or two cases where it effected
complete cures: Mr. Joshua Deer, who had been
in a most helpless condition for a long time,
and had tried many other remedies in vain, was
cured in five days after he commenced using it,
so as to be able to take a ride on horseback,
which can be certified by a number of persons
living in the neighborhood. Any one doubting
the above, can have it proven to their satisfaction
by addressing Ezra Deer, or Henry Gross,
who was cured by it in less time.</p>

<p>Let it be understood that there never was
a preparation that would cure all cases: no, not
one-fourth, therefore I have given a number of
preparations, so that if one fail, others may
prove efficacious, though the above remedy occupies
the head of the list in our own estimation.
Never give up any one remedy until you
have given it a fair trial. “He that holds out
faithfully shall be saved.”</p>

<p>This medicine can be distilled the same as
the cholera medicine, bottled up and kept for
years. Mr. Joshua Deer, was cured with the
distilled. Henry Gross and others used it in
liquor. You must keep from labor and exposure,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
while using the above and be careful not
to eat any thing greasy, or that which will not
agree with you.</p>

<h3>FOR RHEUMATISM.</h3>

<p>Take 1 ounce of saltpetre, 1 quart of ale&mdash;if
ale cannot be had take whiskey or water&mdash;dissolve
the saltpetre in the ale.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Directions for Use.</span></h4>

<p>Take 1 wine glassful before breakfast, 1 before
dinner, 1 before going to bed, and continue
until relieved. Should the second quart do no
good, stop taking it. You must keep from labor
and exposure while using the above. Mr. Dill
was cured by this remedy, who had suffered for
more than a year constantly.</p>

<h3>FOR RHEUMATISM.</h3>

<p>Take 1 ounce of sulphur, 1¼ ounces of saltpetre,
½ ounce of gum guscomb, 2 nutmegs, the
whole to be finely pulverized, to which add 12
ounces of molasses.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Directions for Use.</span></h4>

<p>Take 1 tea spoonful every night before going
to bed, but if it should act too free on the bowels,
the quantity must be diminished.</p>

<h3>LINIMENT FOR RHEUMATISM.</h3>

<p>Take 1 ounce of spirits of camphor, 1 ounce
turpentine, 1 ounce sweet oil, 1 drachm oil of
juniper, 1 drachm carbonate of hartshorn, mix
these perfectly, and apply three times a day,
rubbing it in by the stove or fire with the palm
of the hand for 15 minutes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span></p>

<h3>LINIMENT FOR RHEUMATISM</h3>

<p>Take 2 ounces of saltpetre, 2 ounces spirits of
hartshorn, 8 ounces of sweet oil. Pulverize the
saltpetre as fine as possible, and mix with the
spirits of hartshorn, letting it dissolve, then add
the sweet oil. Bathe and rub in with the palm
of the hand for 15 minutes, at the fire or stove,
wrap with flannel if possible. If not strong
enough you may add hartshorn, if too strong
add sweet oil. This is considered the best liniment
ever introduced for the purpose. Use
freely.</p>

<h3>LINIMENT FOR RHEUMATISM OR NEURALGIA.</h3>

<p>Take 8 cayenne pepper pods, and 1 pint of
whiskey, boil over a fire until it is reduced to
one-half the quantity, when it will be ready for
use. Bathe the parts affected with the liniment
three times a day. This liniment has often
relieved where other remedies have failed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span></p>

<h3>NERVE AND BONE LINIMENT.</h3>

<p>For Swellings, Bruises, Chapped Hands, Frosted
Feet, Rheumatism, Cuts, Burns, Mosquito
Bites, Stings, Pains in the Limbs, Back, Chest,
&amp;c. Take 1 ounce spirits of hartshorn, 1 ounce
spirits camphor, 1 ounce saltpetre, 1 tea spoonful
sweet oil, 2 teaspoonsful laudanum; put all
into a bottle, shake and mix well and it is ready
for use. Bathe in at a fire 3 tablespoonsful 3
times a day, rubbing with the hand for 15 minutes.
Put the liniment into a bottle, and keep
it corked tight. Never pour out more than one
table spoonful at a time, being careful to keep
the bottle corked tight. This liniment is far
superior to any other in use, and you can
make as much for 10 cents as you generally buy
for 50 cents. Try the experiment and see for
yourself.</p>

<p>The spirits of camphor is made by mixing 1½
ounces of gum camphor with ½ pint of 95 per
cent. alcohol. Put into a bottle and let them
dissolve, shake occasionally, after which it will
be ready for use.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span></p>

<p>The spirits of saltpetre is made by taking 2
ounces pulverized saltpetre put into a bottle,
then add 2 ounces spirits of hartshorn, and let
it remain half a day, shaking frequently, then
add scant ½ pint 95 per cent. alcohol, shake and
let it dissolve, when it will be fit for use. For
rheumatism add more hartshorn, and bathe the
parts affected well.</p>

<h3>OINTMENT FOR GOUT AND RHEUMATISM.</h3>

<p>The chloride of gold made into an ointment
with lard is said to speedily relieve the pains of
the gout or rheumatism. It stains the skin
purple, which can be easily removed by washing
it with urine.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span></p>

<h3>FOR RHEUMATISM.</h3>

<p>Take 2 balsam apples, put into ½ gallon of
good fourth proof whiskey in a jug and let it
stand for a week or ten days, shaking occasionally.
Dose, one wine glassful three times a day.
Keep from exposure while using and eat nothing
greasy or that disagrees with the stomach.
This has cured where other remedies have failed,
and should the first ½ gallon not entirely cure,
use the second immediately.</p>

<h3>EFFECTUAL CURE FOR RHEUMATISM.</h3>

<p>The following receipt, given by an Englishman
to a respectable tradesman of Limerick,
(Ireland,) who had for a considerable time labored
under the most violent rheumatic pains
in all his limbs and joints, having been used by
him as directed but 5 or 6 times, as he states,
eradicated the disease completely. Anxious that
so effectual a remedy should be made publicly
known we publish the recipe:</p>

<p>Take 1 ounce of sulphur, 1¼ ounces of saltpetre,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
1½ ounces gum guscomb, 2 nutmegs; the
whole to be finely powdered in a mortar and 12
ounces of molasses. A tea spoonful to be taken
every night on going to bed; should it operate
too much on the bowels, a smaller quantity is to
be taken.</p>

<h3>PLASTER FOR RHEUMATISM.</h3>

<p>Or Pains in the Back, &amp;c. It is said to be a
certain cure. Take 1 pound of rosin and melt
it over a slow fire, then add ½ pint of tar pouring
in slowly, stirring all the time; when it is
well mixed pour all into cold water, and work
it well with your hands. As soon as it is cool
and stiff enough, spread it on a linen rag and
apply it to the affected part. The plaster should
be a little larger than the pain extends&mdash;if you
put the plaster on sheep skin it will be better.
This is sure to give relief.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span></p>

<h3>TO MAKE HONEY WITHOUT BEES.</h3>

<p>Take 8 pounds best brown sugar, 1½ pounds
rendered honey, 1 ounce cream of tartar, 4
drops essence of wintergreen, 2 drops essence of
peppermint, 2 ounces best molasses, 3 parts of
a pint pure cold water, dissolve the cream of
tartar, then put all in a tin or bell metal vessel,
let boil gently 6 or 8 minutes, stirring and mixing
occasionally; then beat up the white of 2
eggs into a foam, and stir them in, and when
nearly cool stir in 2 pounds more of bees honey;
skim off whatever may rise to the top. If you
want it nice and clean, strain it through a coarse
cloth as soon as you have the eggs stirred in.&mdash;If
you strain it put in the 2 lbs. of honey after
it is strained. This makes an excellent honey.
The addition of the eggs is simply to give it the
appearance of having combs in it, but can be
left out if you wish. The same honey may be
used for the second making.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span></p>

<h3>JUDKIN’S OINTMENT.</h3>

<p>Take 1 pound of red lead, ¾ pound rosin, 1
pint linseed oil, 3 tablespoonsful lamp black, 2
ounces British oil, ½ ounce sugar of lead finely
pulverized. Boil this over a slow fire one hour,
then add 1 pint more of linseed oil, and boil
another hour, when done add ½ pint of turpentine
while cooling off, stir and mix well, do not
put the turpentine in when first taken off the
fire. Let it cool 5 minutes, then pour in the
turpentine slowly, stirring well. Should it
catch on fire while pouring in the turpentine,
put a lid or cover over the vessel immediately
to smother the fire. There is no danger in
making if careful, as it will be easily smothered.
Pour out into a new earthen crock, let cool off,
and when cool put into a jar or tin box. There
is nothing better than this preparation for
wounds, fresh or old boils, and cannot be surpassed
for scalds, burns, &amp;c.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span></p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Directions for Use.</span></h4>

<p>Spread a thin coat of the ointment on a piece
of linen rag large enough to cover the scald or
burn, which should be renewed twice a day.&mdash;Scrape
the old ointment off, and the rag may
be used again with another coat of fresh ointment.
For boils cut a hole in the rag so as to
give it room to open and discharge its contents;
renew the ointment three times a day. This is
considered one of the best ointments of the age.
Give it a trial and its effects will soon be felt.</p>

<h3>REMEDY FOR THE BITE OF A SNAKE.</h3>

<p>Take the spirits of camphor made of whiskey
and apply it to the bite, turning the bottle
which contains it over the bite and let it remain
on until all the poison is drawn out. The bottle
used should have a large mouth so that it
may cover the wound entirely. Drink freely of
the whiskey until you begin to feel its effects.
This done in time has never failed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span></p>

<h3>FOR THE PILES.</h3>

<p>Take the kernel of three peach seeds, mash
them well, then add hog’s lard or fresh butter,
not salted, enough to form a salve and rub this
between two butter plates until it becomes of a
bluish color, grease with it and take enough
rhubarb to keep the bowels open.</p>

<h3>CERTAIN CURE FOR CANCER.</h3>

<p>Take 1 pint of strong ley and boil down till
it forms a salve, then apply every 15 minutes
until seven plasters have been applied, and as
soon as it begins to bleed stop the applications,
then work the core out and grease with hog’s
lard to kill it; heal with ointment or some good
salve. When the ley has been boiled down,
should the substance that remains become hard,
work it into a salve. This is also good for the
cure of fistula or poll evil in horses.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span></p>

<h3>FOR WHITE SWELLINGS.</h3>

<p>Take 1 handful of mullin leaves and ½ pint
of old rye whiskey; boil these together and
strain, then add 1 gill of turpentine and 2 gills
of spirits of camphor. Bathe well until all the
swelling and soreness has left, wrap with flannel
which should he dampened with the lotion;
this is a certain remedy.</p>

<h3>TO KEEP CIDER SWEET.</h3>

<p>Make the cider as late in the fall as possible
from solid apples, without using any water, put
away immediately from the press, and lay it in
some place where it may remain quiet, let the
place be as cool as possible. Fill the barrel up
full, take the bung out and leave it out for four
days, filling it up occasionally as it settles or
works out. Should the cider stop working under
4 days, rack it off carefully from the dregs,
which should be done as soon as the cider stops<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
working, then put your cider into a clean sweet
barrel&mdash;it should be a barrel that has had whiskey
or brandy in it&mdash;if not, rinse with water
until perfectly clean, then sweetened by putting
in a small quantity of whiskey. If this cannot
be done soak your barrels well so that they may
be sweet and clean. After having racked your
cider off from the dregs carefully, put in the
whites of 6 eggs, battered light, and a scant ½
pint of mustard seed. Bung up and in 5 or 6
weeks rack it off again carefully from the dregs.
Cleanse the barrel well and put in the same
barrel&mdash;½ gallon of old rye whiskey will add
considerably to its flavor. If your cider is very
sour, add from 3 to 5 lbs. white sugar; to insure
its preservation it should be strained through a
cloth from the press. By being careful&mdash;cider
put up in this way will keep for 5 years.</p>

<h3>FOR BOILED CIDER.</h3>

<p>Make the cider late in the fall, using none
but sound apples, not even those with small
specks in, without any water. Take it right<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
from the press and put it in a copper kettle; boil
it one hour from the time it commences; skim
it off as the skum arises as clean as you can;
then pour into a clean, sweet whiskey barrel,
put into a bag scant ½ pint of mustard seed; let
the bag down through the bung hole by a string,
making the string fast to the barrel so as it can
be drawn out again conveniently. It may be
flavored with ground cinnamon or cloves if you
fancy the taste. Cider put up in this way will
keep a long time and makes an excellent drink,
by adding ½ gallon of old rye whiskey it may
be kept a number of years. Cider, either from
the press or boiled, put into bottles or jugs,
corked up tight and sealed over with sealing-wax;
it can be kept many years, and makes a
delicious drink.</p>

<h3>CHERRY BRANDY.</h3>

<p>Press out the juice and add 1 gallon of water
to 12 gallons of the juice; then dissolve in the
juice 1 pound of white sugar to the gallon; boil
slowly in a copper kettle, and skim off what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
rises to the top. Do not boil too long or it will
get thick; when the skum stops rising freely
pour it into some vessel to cool. Do not allow
it to stand in the kettle to cool. When it has
become cool put into whatever vessel you wish
to keep it in, and add as much old rye whiskey
as may suit your taste, say from 1 to 3 gallons.
The better the whiskey is the better your brandy
will be. Black heart cherries are the best if
they can be had. This makes a much better
drink than port wine.</p>

<h3>BLACK OR DEWBERRY CORDIAL.</h3>

<p>For diarrhœa or summer complaint. This is
made by adding 1 pound of white sugar to 3
pounds of black or dewberries, allowing them
to stand for twelve hours, then pressing out the
juice and strain well, adding 1 third part good
french brandy and 1 tea spoonful of finely pulverized
allspice in every part of the cordial,
which is ready for use at once. This cordial
cannot be surpassed for children and weak
stomachs, &amp;c.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span></p>

<h3>BLACK OR DEWBERRY WINE.</h3>

<p>An excellent wine and a valuable medicine
for home use. To make a wine equal to port
wine, take ripe blackberries, or dewberries are
best; press out the juice, let it stand thirty-six
hours to ferment, skim off whatever rises to the
top, then to every gallon of the juice add one
quart of water and 3 pounds of white sugar.
Let this stand in open vessels for 24 hours, skim
and strain it, then barrel it up until March,
when it should be racked off carefully from the
dregs, and bottled up for use.</p>

<h3>GAS BEER.</h3>

<p>For 8 gallon vessel&mdash;take three pints of fresh
yeast, 3 pints of New Orleans molasses, put into
your keg, then add 3 gallons of fresh water,
bung up, and shake to mix well. Then take a
tin bucket and put in one tea spoonful of ground
cinnamon, 1 of ground cloves, 3 tablespoonsful
of ground allspice, 1 of ginger, 3 pints of molasses,
then pour on it hot water and mix well;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
let this stand some 10 or 15 minutes, then pour
it into the keg and fill up with fresh water,
bung up tight; put something over the bung to
keep it from working out&mdash;use a strong keg for
this purpose. This makes an excellent cooling
drink in summer. Lay your keg in the sun
several hours or until it commences to work.&mdash;In
cold weather lay your keg close to the fire&mdash;in
fifteen or twenty hours it will be fit for use.</p>

<h3>SILVER TOP DRINK.</h3>

<p>Take 1 quart of water, 3 pounds of sugar, 1
tea spoonful of lemon oil; 1 table spoonful of
flour, with the white of 5 eggs well beat up,
mix the above well together, then divide the
syrup and add 4 ounces of carbonate acid in the
other, and bottle for use. Pour about a gill out
of one bottle into a tumbler and the same quantity
out of the other bottle into another glass,
add a little water if you choose, pour the two
together and drink while effervescing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span></p>

<h3>BLACK INK.</h3>

<p>Take 4 ounces of the extract of log wood, ¼
ounce of bycromate of pot ash, 1 pint boiling
water, stir well until all is dissolved&mdash;if the ink
is not black enough, add a little more of bycromate
of pot ash. This preparation will also
answer for coloring goods, &amp;c.</p>

<h3>RED INK.</h3>

<p>Take of spirits of hartshorn 1 pint, pure carmine
½ drachm, put into a bottle and shake well
and it is fit for use.</p>

<h3>INDELLIBLE INK.</h3>

<p>Take of lunar caustic 100 grains, gum arabic
100 grains, make both fine and pour water
enough over to dissolve it, put into a phial and
stop tightly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span></p>

<p>To make the preparation to be used before
writing on the linen, take 2 drachms of salts of
tartar; 2 drachms gum arabic, dissolve these in
1 ounce of rain water. Before using the ink,
wet whatever article you wish to mark with this
last preparation and dry with a smooth iron,
then wash the gum out and you have the name
indellibly fixed.</p>

<h3>ANOTHER BLACK INK.</h3>

<p>Take 1 pound logwood, 1 gallon soft water,
boil it 1 hour and add 25 grains of bycromate
of pot ash, 12 grains of prusiate of pot ash,
stir a few minutes over the fire, take it off, and
when settled strain it.</p>

<h3>WASHING FLUID.</h3>

<p>Take 1 gallon of soft soap, 4 ounces of sal
soda, ½ gallon soft water, and ½ gill of spirits of
turpentine, place them all into a pot over a fire
and allow the mixture to boil a few minutes, it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
is then ready for use and can be kept in an
earthen or stone vessel. In using this fluid the
clothes intended to be washed should be soaked
in water 10 or 12 hours, say over night, and
then to a 10 or 12 gallon boiler or kettle full
of clothes, covered with water, add 1 pint of
fluid, boil briskly for fifteen minutes, and then
wring them out in fresh water. It will be found
that little or no rubbing will be necessary.&mdash;This
preparation will save a great deal of hard
rubbing and labor&mdash;it is truly worth trying.</p>

<h3>TRANSPARENT SOAP.</h3>

<p>Take 3 pounds of best rosin soap, 1 quart of
best alcohol, 1 ounce of venice turpentine, 1
ounce of oil of sassafras, or you may use bergamot
or the oil of lemon, or cinnamon, either
of which will answer. Cut the soap into thin
shavings, put into a pan the alcohol and soap,
melt over a slow fire so as just to keep from
boiling; when all is dissolved let it boil a minute<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
or two, you must be careful not to let the
blaze of the fire get to it or it will catch on fire;
it is best to put it on a stove where there will
be no danger, keep stirring slowly until all is
melted, then add your venice turpentine, stirring
and mixing for a minute or so, then take
your pan off the fire and put in your oil of sassafras
immediately, or whatever oil you intend
using, the oil of sassafras is however the best.
This soap cannot be surpassed for shaving,
washing, and is excellent for sore or rough
hands. Try it and you will be surprised&mdash;the
rosin soap used must be clear.</p>

<h3>PROF. BIDDLE’S CELEBRATED PREPARATION
FOR THE HAIR AND HEAD.</h3>

<p>To make 1 quart, take nearly one half a pint
of cold pressed castor oil and fill it nearly full
of 95 per cent. alcohol, then add ½ ounce of
spirits of hartshorn, ½ ounce of tincture of cantharides,
40 drops oil of bergamot, which gives
it an elegant perfume&mdash;shake well and it is
ready for use.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span></p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Directions for Use.</span></h4>

<p>Wash your head first with whiskey, then apply
the hair oil freely, pour it on the head gently
and rub with the hand or stiff brush. For
children only use the hair oil. To remove the
dandruff, comb the head well with a fine comb,
do this every time you use the preparation. This
oil should be applied twice a week, which will
loosen the dandruff so that it may be easily removed.
A great and valuable discovery for the
hair and head, two or three applications of which
will remove every particle of dandruff, purify
the skin and prevent the hair from coming out,
giving new life and vigor to every hair on the
head, and changing light or sandy hair to a
beautiful dark lustre; also curing dizzy or nervous
headache. No one should be without this
valuable preparation, especially those who are
subject to dandruff eruptions of the skin, falling
off of the hair, dizzy or nervous headache. If
it should make the head tender, only use half
the tincture of cantharides. The alcohol must
be strictly 95 per cent.&mdash;you can add hartshorn
if not strong enough, also bergamot for perfume<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
to suit. It is good for tetter on the head.
Every ingredient can be had at almost any of
the drug stores.</p>

<h3>TO RESTORE THE HAIR IN BALDNESS.</h3>

<p>Take of cold pressed castor oil 2 ounces, tincture
of cantharides ½ ounce, acetic acid ½ ounce,
strong water of amonia 1½ ounces, oil of nutmegs
½ drachm, oil of lavender ½ drachm, put
this in a bottle, make into a lotion, when it will
be ready for use.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Directions for Use.</span></h4>

<p>The head should be perfectly cleaned of all
dirt and dandruff, with castile soap and warm
water, and the lotion applied freely and rubbed
in with a stiff hair brush once a day; in a week
or two its good effects will be manifested. This
is the best preparation for baldness yet introduced&mdash;give
it a fair trial and you will not be
disappointed. The drugs of this preparation
can be had at any of the drug stores.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span></p>

<h3>TOOTHACHE BALSAM.</h3>

<p>Take of creosote 1 drachm, oil of cloves 1
drachm, tincture of camphor 2 drachms, oil of
petroleum 2 drachms, mix them thoroughly and
cork tight for use. A few drops of this mixture
on cotton and applied to the nerve of the
tooth will relieve the pain.</p>

<h3>TOOTH POWDER.</h3>

<p>Take of supercarbonate of soda 1 ounce, pulverized
orris root ½ an ounce, cream of tartar ½
ounce, oil of roses 10 drops, mix them properly.
This may be used with the finger, rag or soft
tooth brush.</p>

<h3>ANOTHER TOOTH POWDER.</h3>

<p>Carbonate of magnesia any quantity, perfumed
with the oil of cinnamon or neroli. This
is the best tooth powder for children&mdash;the teeth
should always be cleaned after eating, if you
wish to keep the breath sweet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span></p>

<h3>COLOGNE WATER No. 1.</h3>

<p>Take of oil of bergamot 1 ounce, oil of lavender
½ ounce, oil of neroli 1 drachm, oil of
roses 15 drops, oil of cloves 30 drops, new milk
1 pint, pure alcohol 1 gallon, digest 1 day and
filter through close flannel several times.</p>

<h3>COLOGNE WATER No. 2.</h3>

<p>Take of oil of bergamot 1 ounce, oil of lemon
1 ounce, oil of lavender 3 ounces, tincture of
muck 1 drachm, pure alcohol 7 pints, rose water
1 pint, gum camphor 20 grains, mix and digest

<h3>COLOGNE WATER No. 3.</h3>

<p>Take oil of roses 5 drops, oil of bergamot 1
ounce, oil of lemon 1 ounce, oil of lavender 2½<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
ounces, oil of rosemary ½ ounce, oil of cinnamon
10 drops, pure alcohol 7 pints, new milk 1 pint.
Let the mixture stand one day and filter. All
preparations of cologne should be kept closely

flavor.</p>

<h3>TOOTHACHE DROPS.</h3>

<p>Take of 95 per cent. alcohol 1 pint, oil of
origanum 2 ounces, gum camphor 2 ounces, tartaric
acid ½ ounce. Digest 1 day and mix well,
when it will be ready for use&mdash;cork up tight.&mdash;A
few drops of this mixture on cotton applied
to the nerve, and the gums well rubbed with it
will soon relieve the pain. This is harmless and
pleasant. If you cannot get any cotton to the
nerve, bathe the tooth and gums well with it.</p>

<h3>FOR DYSPEPSIA.</h3>

<p>Take of 1½ pounds of white mustard seed from
1 tea spoonful to 1 table spoonful, between
meals&mdash;the whole seeds in cold water.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span></p>

<h3>TO PRESERVE BUTTER No. 1.</h3>

<p>Take saltpetre and loaf sugar of an equal
proportion and make a liquid. After packing
the butter in a jar or sweet keg, pour over
enough of the liquid to cover the butter an inch
or two. If you should wish to re-pack the butter,
pour off the liquid, which if sweet, may be
used again when you have done packing.</p>

<h3>TO PRESERVE BUTTER No. 2.</h3>

<p>Reduce separately to a fine powder, in a dry
mortar, 2 pounds of the best common salt, 1
pound of saltpetre and 1 pound of loaf sugar;
sift one of them over the other on a sheet of
paper, then mix them well together and they
are ready for use. 1 ounce of the preparation
is enough, to a pound of butter, and if well
worked in will preserve it sweet for three years.
This is worth giving a trial.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span></p>

<h3>TO PICKEL CUCUMBERS.</h3>

<p>Let your cucumbers be small, fresh gathered
and free from spots; then make a pickel of salt
and water, strong enough to bear up an egg;
boil the pickel in a copper kettle if convenient;
and skim it well; then pour it upon the cucumbers
and tie them down for 24 hours, strain out
through a colander and dry off well with a cloth.</p>

<p>Take the best wine or cider vinegar, cloves,
mace, nutmegs, pepper and race ginger, boil
them together and put the cucumbers in with a
little salt, as soon as they begin to turn their
color, put them into jars, crocks or tight barrels;
when cold tie on a bladder or leather.
This is excellent and worthy attention.</p>

<h3>SOFT GINGER BREAD.</h3>

<p>Four cups of molasses, 2 of butter, 2 of milk,
eight eggs, two teaspoonsful of pearlash, ginger,
and sufficient flour to make it stiff as pound
cake.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span></p>

<h3>TO PRESERVE PEACHES.</h3>

<p>Take ripe free stone peaches&mdash;pare, stone and
quarter them; to six pounds of the cut peaches
allow three pounds of the best brown sugar;
stew the sugar and peaches together, and set
them away in a covered vessel; next morning
put them into a preserving kettle and boil it
slowly about an hour and three quarters, skimming
it well.</p>

<h3>TO PRESERVE PLUMBS, &amp;c.</h3>

<p>A pound of sugar to a pound of fruit; the
sugar should be melted over a fire, moderate
enough not to scorch it when melted. It should
be skimmed clean and the fruit dropped in to
simmer until it is soft. Put them in jars and
cover carefully from the air. Glass is much
better than earthen for preserves&mdash;they are not
so apt to ferment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span></p>

<h3>SOAP TO TAKE GREASE OUT OF CLOTH,
SATINS, SILKS, &amp;c.</h3>

<p>Take 4 pounds of white bar soap, 1½ pints 95
per cent. alcohol, 1½ ounces of nitric acid, 2 do.
of saltpetre, 2 ounces soda, ¾ ounce camphor; cut
the bar soap into thin shavings, put all the
above ingredients in a crock, then boil over a
slow fire, with very little blaze; pulverize your
camphor as fine as possible and when all is
properly dissolved, which will take 1 hour or so
then take the pot off the fire and when cooled
add 1½ ounces spirits of amonia, pour in slowly
stirring all the time; should it catch on fire
smother it with a cover or by throwing a cloth
over the pot. Stir while boiling, and scent with
½ ounce of oil of cinnamon. This will remove
grease spots from cloth, silks, &amp;c., by taking a
tooth brush&mdash;dip into water and make a lather
with the soap, rub the grease spot well with the
brush and lather, then wash it out twice in cold
water, rinsing and squeezing the soap out as
clean as possible&mdash;let it be clean water each
time. This will take grease, paint, tar, oil, &amp;c.,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
out of any kind of goods when properly applied.
By pouring it in a flat pan you can cut
your soap into cakes of any size.</p>

<h3>SOAP FOR GREASE, TAR, PAINT, &amp;c.</h3>

<p>Take 1 quart 95 per cent. alcohol, 2¾ pounds
best home made soap; cut the soap into thin
shavings, then put the soap and alcohol into a
pan or vessel over a slow fire, and let all dissolve
before it boils; when dissolved boil a few minutes,
then pour the soap into a pan, and when
cooled off cut into cakes. This preparation is
excellent for washing dirty clothes and will not
require near the labor that the common soap
does. For cloth, silks, &amp;c., you may take less
soap. It may be used in the same manner directed
for the other soap.</p>

<h3>REMEDY FOR ITCH No. 1</h3>

<p>Take broad dock roots and lard sufficient to
form a mixture, boil it until it forms a salve.&mdash;Bury<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
the salve in the ground for 24 hours, then
grease 2 or 3 times every evening before going
to bed, dry in by the stove and shift the clothes.
It never fails. Take sulphor of brimstone several
days before applying the salve. This plant
is not the burdock nor the narrowdock, which it
resembles, except that the leaves of the broad
dock are broader and the stocks do not grow
near so high.</p>

<h3>REMEDY FOR ITCH No. 2.</h3>

<p>Take 4 ounces of venice turpentine, 4 ounces
of red precipitate, 1 pound of unwashed butter.
The turpentine must be washed 9 times in fresh
spring water, then mix all the ingredients
thoroughly. Apply several times of an evening
before going to bed and dry in at the stove, after
which put on clean clothes. Avoid getting
wet while using this salve. Take sulphor and
cream of tartar 2 or 3 days before applying.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span></p>

<h3>REMEDY FOR ITCH No. 3.</h3>

<p>Take narrow dock and grate it, then add
sweet milk or cream and fry them together and
grease with it 3 or 4 times every evening, drying
in at the stove, then dress with clean
clothes. Take ½ tea spoonful of sulphor twice
a day several days before and after. This is a
certain cure.</p>

<h3>PILLS BY DR. W. B. YOUNG.</h3>

<p>Take calomel, jalap, aloes and rhubarb, equal
portions, mix all together and add a little water
at a time, and mix until you cannot see the calomel
grains, roll in powdered helebore or epicac.
Dose from 1 to 3 pills once a day in the evening.
Roll the mixture out in rolls and cut up
to make the regular sizes. These are an excellent
domestic pill.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span></p>

<h3>FRENCH PATENT OIL VARNISH.</h3>

<p>For Boots, Shoes, Harness and Carriages:&mdash;Take
1 gallon alcohol, 1¼ pounds gum shellac,
8 ounces of white turpentine, 4 ounces of rosin,
4 ounces of venice turpentine, 4 ounces oil of
lavender, 1 ounce lamp black to color with; put
the gum shellac and alcohol into a jug and
shake, let it stand a day or two to dissolve, then
add the other ingredients and shake well until
all is dissolved, when it is ready for use. In
applying this polish use a sponge or brush,
lightly and briskly, and it will make a beautiful
polish. It will render leather water proof,
but if used regularly a small quantity of oil
should be applied occasionally.</p>

<h3>COX’S HIVE SYRUP.</h3>

<p>Take of bruised squills 10 drachms, seneca
snake root 10 drachms; add the squills and
snake root to 1 pint of water that has been first
boiled, settled and poured off and simmer slowly
until you have but half a pint of water, then
strain it off and add clarified sugar 1 pound,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
and simmer until all are well mixed, then add
tartar emetic 22 grains, salts of tartar 22 grains,
stir and mix properly while the fluid is warm,
stop it up tight for use. This syrup is good in
coughs, croup or bad colds in children, in 10 or
15 drop doses&mdash;no family should do without it
one day. If you do not wish to be troubled
making it, buy some and always keep it in your
house. It is a sure and safe remedy for croup,
in which little larger doses should be administered
often until it vomits pretty freely&mdash;continue
with the syrup until the tightness is broken,
then use occasionally, not enough to vomit
so often. By keeping this remedy at hand you
may save some one of your family, and a large
amount of trouble and expense. In croup put
a mustard plaster on the breast and throat immediately,
as no time is to be lost. Mustard
plaster is made with ground mustard and wheat
flour equal parts; mix them together and wet
with warm vinegar, greasing the throat and
breast with turpentine or good liniment; putting
flannel around the neck is very good.&mdash;Young
parents should be on their guard when
not acquainted with the disease.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span></p>

<h3>DOMESTIC COUGH SYRUP.</h3>

<p>Take of cumfrey root one ounce, elecampane
root 1 ounce, nettle root 1 ounce, hoarhound
leaves 1 ounce, spikenard root ½ ounce, pulverize
all fine and boil them in a quart of water
down to a pint, strain the liquor off and when
settled pour off again; add to it 1 pint of strained
honey, and simmer down slowly to a pint and
a half; add to it scant ½ ounce juice of indian
turnip; take a green turnip and beat and squeeze
the juice out, add to the syrup when milk warm;
if put in while hot it will lose its medical
properties. A table spoonful or less may be
taken from 4 to 6 times a day, in cases of bad
cough, it is healing and strengthening to the
lungs; it may be made with or without the indian
turnip juice. The indian turnip is an excellent
of itself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span></p>

<h3>GREAT SALVE FOR WOUNDS, &amp;c.</h3>

<p>Take 1 pound sheep tallow, 1 pound beeswax,
½ pound rosin elder inside bark, 1 pound balm
of gillead leaves or flowers, put into a pan and
fry over a slow fire to a salve, spread thin on a
linen rag and apply 2 or 3 times a day.</p>

<h3>SODA POWDERS.</h3>

<p>To make these powders put 1 tea spoonful of
carbonate of soda into a glass nearly half full of
water, and ½ tea spoonful of tartaric acid in the
other, and add enough sugar and lemon syrup
or lemon juice to suit the taste; stir and dissolve
the powders and sugar, then pour one into the
other and drink while effervescing. This is a
very pleasant and cooling drink.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span></p>

<h3>PATENT BLACK JAPAN.</h3>

<p>For iron or wood carriages, &amp;c. Take 1 gallon
of turpentine, 2¼ pounds asphaltum, put
them into an iron pot over a charcoal fire and
let remain until dissolved, then strain it&mdash;if it
becomes too thick when cold add spirits of turpentine.
For wood or canvass add while hot,
to every gallon 1 pint of copal varnish and ½
pint of linseed oil. This is a good and cheap
paint or varnish, used by a great many coach-makers,
blacksmiths, &amp;c.</p>

<h3>TO MAKE SOFT SOAP.</h3>

<p>Take 10 pounds of common yellow or rosin
soap, such as is purchased here for 4 or 6 cents
per pound, 6 pounds sal-soda, 10 gallons soft
or rain water; cut the soap into small thin pieces
and put the whole over a fire, bring the water
nearly to a boiling point and allow it to remain
at that temperature until the soap is thoroughly
dissolved; it may then be taken off. If the soap
made with these ingredients is found to be too
strong add cold water until it becomes of the
proper consistency and strength.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span></p>

<h3>FURNITURE POLISH.</h3>

<p>Take ¼ pound beeswax, separate into shavings,
put in a pan and add ½ gallon of spirits
of turpentine and 1 pint linseed oil; let it remain
for 12 hours, then stir it well with a stick
into a liquid; while stirring add ¼ pound shellac
varnish and 1 ounce alkinet root. Put this
mixture into a gallon jar and stand it before a
fire or in an oven for a week, just to keep it
warm, shaking it up 3 or 4 times a day, then
strain it through a hair sieve or fine flannel. In
using pour a tea spoonful on a wad of baize or
flannel, and go lightly over the face or other
parts of the mahogany furniture, then apply a
similar dry wad briskly and in three minutes
it will produce a dark brilliant polish, unequalled
and of great value. The shellac varnish is
made by taking ¼ pound good gum shellac and
pouring alcohol enough over to dissolve it, say
as much as to cover the shellac.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span></p>

<h3>ESSENCE OF LEMON.</h3>

<p>Take 1 pint alcohol, ½ ounce of oil of lemon,
color with tincture of tamarisk. To make these
essences for family use you should take 95 per
cent. alcohol and the quantity of oil named in
the receipt, which will save you three hundred
per cent. paying you for your labor. If you
wish to make a pint, get a glass bottle that will
hold a little more than a pint and put your alcohol
and oil in, shake and mix them well, then
color to suit.</p>

<p>To make 1 gallon of the essences for sale,
take 1 gallon of common alcohol and 2 ounces
of the oil&mdash;color as in the others.</p>

<h3>ESSENCE OF PEPPERMINT.</h3>

<p>Take 1 pint alcohol, ½ ounce of oil of peppermint,
and if you wish it colored add in small
quantities the tincture of tamarisk, stirring it,
until you have the color to suit your taste. This
is excellent for cramp colic in man or horse.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span></p>

<h3>EYE WATER.</h3>

<p>Take 40 grains sulphate of zinc to ½ pint of
warm soft water, shake until well dissolved and
cork up tightly. In using pour out about 1
tea spoonful into a cup and bathe the eyes with
it. Never use by dipping your finger into the
bottle, but pour a small quantity out into a vessel
of some kind. This is the best eye water
yet introduced and will be certain to relieve the
inflamed eye. Try it and its efficacy will soon
be manifested. Always bathe the eye of an
evening, just before going to bed&mdash;if it is used
during the day you should keep out of the air.
If too strong add a little water. The cost of
this preparation is but 6¼ cents, and cannot be
surpassed.</p>

<h3>ESSENCE OF CINNAMON.</h3>

<p>Take 1 pint of alcohol, ½ ounce of oil of cinnamon,
color with the tincture of red sanders,
and mix as above. This is excellent in diarrhœa,
summer complaints or looseness of the bowels.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span></p>

<h3>CERTAIN CURE FOR FELON.</h3>

<p>We have known instances of the most intense
suffering, neither rest by day or sleep at night,
in which this process has effected cures. As soon
as it becomes apparent that a felon is making its
appearance, which is known by a constant soreness
and pain proceeding from the bone, take a
strong cord of any kind and wrap it about the
afflicted part, as tightly as can be borne; keep
it in this condition until the pain can be endured
no longer. Now loose the cords and soon as the
pain, caused by the cording subsides, tighten it
again. Continue this for several days or until
the felon is completely blackened and killed.&mdash;We
have known several persons who have been
afflicted with felons to try this remedy with
success&mdash;in fact we have never known it to fail.
The cording stops the circulation and then the
sore has nothing to feed upon, when it soon dies
of starvation. We have faith in this remedy,
even after a felon has made considerable progress.
If the felon has commenced at the bone<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
the sooner you have it cut the better; there is no
application that will burst or open the skin that
is next to the bone, it should be cut if the above
remedy fails.&mdash;<cite>Clipper.</cite></p>

<h3>CURE FOR BRONCHITIS.</h3>

<p>Croton oil it is said will entirely remove this
complaint. A minister of the gospel who had
been laid aside from his pastoral office by the
bronchitis, for three years, has entirely recovered
his voice by the application of croton oil to the
surface of the throat, against the organ affected,
one drop daily rubbed over the surface produced
a singular but powerful eruption of the skin,
which as it progressed restored his voice to its
full tone and vigor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span></p>

<h3>RECEIPT FOR HOGS.</h3>

<p>That have lost their appetite. Put urine in
the slop, or when you can conveniently, urinate
in the trough as you pass along. This is excellent,
but a small quantity of ashes put in their
slop cannot be surpassed for restoring the appetite,
and also very good for the kidneys, worms,
&amp;c. Give it a trial and be convinced of its efficacy.</p>

<h3>GREASE FOR CARRIAGES, &amp;c.</h3>

<p>Take 1 pound of beeswax, ½ pint of lamp
black, mix well while hot, and when cooling off,
add oil until it becomes of a proper consistency.
In the winter season add more oil. This makes
a lasting grease, which cannot be surpassed for
carriages, &amp;c.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span></p>

<h3>FOR PLAGUE BLISTER.</h3>

<p>Take sassafras leaves and dip them in warm
water, then take castile soap and make a thick
lather, and apply with a soft brush as far as the
sore or inflammation extends, then apply the
sassafras leaves, warm 3 or 4 thick, tie it up
loosely, renew every 8 hours. This cannot be
surpassed for inflammation of this nature. Give
it a trial and its effects will soon be felt. Use
none but castile soap.</p>

<p>The following certificate attests the value of
this simple cure:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Middletown</span> Frederick Co., Md.<br />
June 5th, 1852.</p>

<p><i>To all whom it may concern, greeting</i>:&mdash;</p>

<p>I hereby certify, that some time in March, 1847, my wife was
afflicted with a pain and swelling in her arm, which proved extremely
painful, and appeared to be contracting the arm, leaving
a red or purple streak as far as the swelling extended. As
some three or four of my children were then lying sick with scarlet
fever, also a negro girl, several physicians were sent for to
attend them, who were consulted in relation to my wife. Some
pronounced it the hysterics, others attempted to effect a cure,
but all in vain; at length it was pronounced a pest or plague
blister and very dangerous. The person who informed me what
it was, recommended me to Mr. J. D. Koogle for a cure. Mr.
Koogle came and applied poultices, which in an hour or two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
after the first application relieved her so much as to enable her
to sleep, which she had not done for ten or twelve days. Previous
to this the physicians recommended every thing that had
a tendency to induce sleep without avail. Nothing could ease
her pain so as to enable her to sleep. She continued the poultices
recommended by Mr. Koogle until finally relieved, though
they left the hand and part of the arm perfectly hollow&mdash;nothing
but skin, bone and sinew&mdash;yet the parts are now entirely
healed and as full as usual, without any other application.</p>

<p class="center">Yours, &amp;c.</p>

<p class="right">JACOB T. C. MILLER.</p>

</div>

<h3>RECEIPT FOR HUMORS OR BREAKING
OUT ON CHILDREN.</h3>

<p>Take wheat flour and put into a hot stove,
roast it to a brown color, stir and mix it while
browning. In using sprinkle on the sore&mdash;it
scarcely ever fails to heal after all other remedies
have failed. The sores should not be dried
up too suddenly, and particularly when it is a
general breaking out over the face, hands, &amp;c.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span></p>

<h3>CERTAIN CURE FOR BITE OF A SNAKE.</h3>

<p>Drink as much whiskey as you can. It will
do no harm and is a certain cure&mdash;use it immediately
after the bite.</p>

<h3>CURE FOR THE BITE OF A MAD DOG.</h3>

<p>Take of elecampane root 1½ ounces, cut it fine
or pulverize if you can, then boil it in one pint
of new milk down to a quarter of a pint. Take
this in the morning fasting, and eat no food till
4 o’clock in the afternoon. It should be taken
every other morning&mdash;the two last doses must
weigh 2 ounces each. This may be used several
times a day.</p>

<h3>CLAY POULTICE FOR MAN OR HORSE.</h3>

<p>Take of yellow clay any quantity, and add
vinegar enough to form a poultice, apply it cold.
To a sprained joint it gives very speedy relief,
often cures in one night. This cannot be surpassed
for a fresh sprain on horses.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span></p>

<h3>DOMESTIC TONIC.</h3>

<p>Yellow poplar bark, dogwood bark, wild
cherry bark, 1 ounce of each; pulverize fine, and
add to them 1 quart of whiskey, shake the bottle
and let it stand one week. A table spoonful
in water three times a day is a dose in cases of
debility after fevers.</p>

<h3>OINTMENT FOR SCROFULUS ULCERS.</h3>

<p>Take of basilicon ointment 1 ounce, venice
turpentine ½ oz., pulverized verdigris 2 drachms,
beef gall ½ ounce, mix them perfectly over a
slow fire. Dress the sores twice a day&mdash;do not
wet them but wipe them clean with a soft rag.</p>

<h3>GREEN OINTMENT.</h3>

<p>Take basilicon ointment ½ pound, finely pulverized¾
verdigris ½ ounce; melt the basilicon
slowly and add the verdigris, stirring until it
is well mixed. This is a good dressing for old
sores and ring worms on the head or face.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span></p>

<h3>TINCTURE OF PEACH KERNELS.</h3>

<p>Take ½ pint of peach kernels, bruise them and
add one quart of whiskey. Take a table spoonful
three times a day. This often cures gravel
in the form of sand or fine gravel in the bladder.
We have known the patient to pass off
gravel in large quantities while using this remedy.</p>

<h3>FOR TRANSPLANTING TREES.</h3>

<p>That are flagging or drooping, or looking as
if they were going to say good bye. First reduce
the top litter, or if needed a good deal, it
may be that there is more top to exhaust than
root to supply; then loosen the soil and water
if dry, and lastly mulch the ground as far as
the roots extend. This you may do by covering
it with three or four inches of straw. Litter
tan bark or something of that sort to keep the
roots cool and moist, so as to cause them into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
new growth. Watering a transplanted tree
every day, letting the surface dry hard with the
sun and wind, is too much like basting a joint
of meat before the kitchen fire to be looked upon
as decent treatment, for any thing living when
you water do it after the sun sets. If you find
your fruit trees barren from too great running
to wood, (about the first of June is the time)
clip or pinch off the ends of the side shoots, so
as to expend its substance in making buds instead
of wasting all the sap in over growth.</p>

<h3>HOW TO KEEP APPLES.</h3>

<p>Spread on the floor oats to the depth of about
two inches; the oats should be good and properly
cured, and then place your apples side by
side on the oats until they are covered over with
them. Then cover your apples again, and continue
laying a course of apples and oats until
you have finished your crop. If they are properly
put up they will keep better in this way
than any other way. Farmer try it and convince
yourself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span></p>

<h3>DOMESTIC YEAST.</h3>

<p>Boil 1 pound of good flour, ¼ pound of brown
sugar and a little salt with two gallons of water
for one hour. When milk warm bottle it and
cork close; it will be fit for use in 24 hours; 1
pound yeast will make 18 pounds of bread.</p>

<h3>COMPOST TO PREVENT CROWS AND
INSECTS FROM TAKING CORN.</h3>

<p>Take from 1 to 2 pounds sulphor brimstone
mixed with plaster and ashes, and a handful
scattered on to the corn as it peeps out of the
ground will be sufficient to protect an acre from
their ravages. Brimstone is a good manure on
all soil that does not abound in it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span></p>

<h3>HOW TO DESTROY LICE OR VERMIN
ON CHICKENS.</h3>

<p>Place among the sand and dust that the hens
dust themselves in ½ pound black sulphor and
also sprinkle some lime in and mix. This will
keep them off and give them a glossy appearance.
If infested with these insects dampen the
skin under the feathers with a little water, then
sprinkle a little black sulphor on the skin, and
in 12 hours they will all disappear. Also, previous
to setting a hen, if the nest be slightly
sprinkled with the sulphor there, is no danger
of the hen becoming annoyed by them.</p>

<h3>WORTH KNOWING.</h3>

<p>One pound of green copperas, costing 6 cents,
dissolved in 1 quart of water, and poured down
a privy, will effectually destroy the foulest
smells; for water closets aboard ships and steamboats,
or for rats, mice, &amp;c., keep it dissolved<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
near the place and in a few days it will all disappear.
About hotels and other public places,
there is nothing so nice to cleanse places as simple
green copperas dissolved under the bed in any
thing that will hold water, and thus render a
hospital and other places for the sick free from
unpleasant smells. For butchers’ stalls, fish
markets, slaughter houses, sinks and wherever
there are offensive and putrid gasses, dissolve
copperas and sprinkle it about, and in a few days
the smell will pass away.</p>

<h3>INFORMATION HOW TO TREAT DANGEROUS DISEASES.</h3>

<p>There are several diseases which are very
dangerous and run their course in a very short
time, and prove fatal if they are not properly
treated or arrested before they become firmly
seated. I would here urge upon every owner
of horses, (and in fact every disease which this
work treats on,) to pay strict attention to it.
In many diseases, what you can do must be done
at once or not at all&mdash;the old saying is ‘a stitch
in time saves nine,’ and there is a great deal
of truth in this, in many diseases.</p>

<p>I would here urge upon you the importance
of glystering in certain diseases. In the Wind
Colic and also in the Spasmodic Colic, as soon
as you ascertain what the disease is and not before.
The truth of the matter is that no man
has any right to give any medicine until he is
certain what the disease is. Give the medicine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
and course of treatment prescribed in the disease
then quickly follow with injections. If you
have neglected to prepare yourself for glystering,
back-rake with your hand&mdash;this is done by
greasing the hand and arm with lard or oil and
introduce it as far as you can. The glystering
or back-raking never does any harm but always
assists in relieving. Every owner of horses
should prepare himself with several large beef
or hog bladders, a few elders with the pith
punched or burnt out, and by so doing you are
prepared at any time to give an injection. This
may be done by cutting a notch around the one
end of the elder, then fill your bladder with
soap suds or oil, next tie the bladder on the end
of the elder you have notched, firmly, and introduce
the elder into the fundament, and then
you can force the suds into the fundament easily
by pressing on the bladder. You should in all
cases where there is great danger of losing your
horse, give injections and continue to repeat
them until they operate. There are many
cases in colics that the horse is bound or corked,
this can be perceived by the horse trying frequently
or straining to dung; when this does<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
occur it is very dangerous and you must in these
cases give large doses of aloes and glyster freely,
repeating until you get it to operate. If
you fail to get an operation you will lose your
horse. Preparation for glystering: Take warm
water and make a suds with soap, add thereto
epsom salts, and in some cases you may add ½
oz. aloes. Fish oil is a very good article of itself;
from a pint to a quart for one injection.
I have known 1 pint of fish oil to be given as a
drench in colic, and has relieved where all other
remedies have failed.</p>

<p>I will here state that there are more horses
killed by medicine improperly given than ever
was cured. For this reason, the great majority
of owners of horses and in fact a great many
farriers who pretend to know, do not know
what the disease is, and next is a dose of medicine
and perhaps in less than half an hour the
horse drops down dead, and why, because in
many cases the medicine given for the disease,
is the dose that poisons or kills him, from the
fact that he was mistaken in the disease, or
given medicine for one disease when it was
another. Therefore, I here again assert that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
no man has any right to give medicine until he
fully ascertains what the disease is. This he
can easily get at if he will pay some attention
to the symptoms which are so plainly described
in this work. As soon as your horse commences
to complain, watch him closely and you will
find him to point out to you plainly what the
disease is, and you will find the horse to point
it out to a hair’s breadth as I have described it
to you.</p>

<p>Why is it that men will toil and labor hard
through the summer’s heat, and expose themselves
to the extreme cold in winter, and at the
end of the year perhaps, will lose more in horse
flesh than they have made. Millions of dollars
are lost yearly in horses and a great part of it
for the want of carefulness and paying some attention
to the diseases of the horse, which costs
no man any hard labor or exposure. Let me
urge upon you the importance of reading this
work over again and again, paying attention to
it as you peruse it over, and you will find it
gives you such information as each and every
person should have for his own interest. I will
here state that an ounce of preventative is a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
great deal better than a pound of cure. Many
diseases might be prevented by being cautious
in their treatment to horses and keeping them
in a healthy condition. This should be done
by using the celebrated horse powders on page
<a href="#Page_60">60</a>, twice a year, fall and spring. Say you feed
from 1 to 1½ pounds to each horse, each time,
fall and spring. If you adopt this once you
will never depart from it afterward, as you will
find it to be a preventative of diseases and will
find so much improvement in your stock that
you will not depart from it. Every man that
has a horse should habit himself to sprinkle a
little salt on the feed every time he feeds his
horse. The salt is nourishing and is just as
much needed in the horse’s food every meal as
it is needed on the food that a man eats.</p>

<p>The Inflammation of the Lungs is another
dangerous disease. It is becoming to be a common
disease among horses, and carries off its
thousands, simply because it is at first a sneaking
disease; the farmer and owner thinks very
little of it when it first makes its appearance,
and the truth is there are very few persons who
know anything about the disease, and if it is suffered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
to run over the third day, you might as
well take the horse out where you want him to
die; yet, with all its danger and certainty of
death if neglected, there is not a disease which
is plainer in its symptoms or is pointed out
plainer by the horse than in this disease. It is
impossible to be mistaken in this disease if you
but pay the least attention to it, and is easily
conquered if taken in time. In this disease the
foxglove, tartar emetic and nitre should be used
twice or thrice a day, as directed in Inflammation
of the Lungs.</p>

<p>Bots is another which is very dangerous when
they take hold. Feed the Celebrated Horse
Powders, as directed and use plenty of salt and
you will not have one case in a thousand of
Bots.</p>

<p>I will here name a few Domestic Medicines,
Receipts, &amp;c., and would urge every person and
family to make use of them and keep them on
hand, as they have proven to be very valuable
and will do what they are recommended to do.
Dr. Wickey’s Cholera Medicine cannot be surpassed
for cholera, cholera morbus, diarrhœa,
summer complaint, looseness of the bowels, sickness
of the stomach, cramp colic, flux, &amp;c. This
Medicine is easily prepared and will keep for
many years if made out of good brandy. There
is not any Medicine now in use that will give
the same amount of satisfaction as this, and it
is perfectly safe and harmless, as it is purely
vegetable, see page <a href="#Page_148">148</a>.</p>

<p>Prof. Biddle’s preparation for the hair and
head will positively cure the tetter or any itching
or humor of the skin, will prevent the hair<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
from falling off, and has restored more hair than
any other hair restorative ever introduced, see
page <a href="#Page_174">174</a>.</p>

<p>If you want sweet cider the year round, turn
to page <a href="#Page_165">165</a> and follow directions, and you will
have it; if you want honey without bees, turn
to page <a href="#Page_161">161</a> and you can have it; if you have
the rheumatism and want to be cured, turn to
pages <a href="#Page_152">152</a>, <a href="#Page_153">153</a>, <a href="#Page_154">154</a> and <a href="#Page_155">155</a>; if you want a liniment
that cannot be surpassed and is easily
made, turn to page <a href="#Page_157">157</a> and you will see how to
make it. You should add double the quantity
of laudanum and use the spirits of saltpetre&mdash;which
is made by pouring alcohol over the saltpetre,
the same as the camphor.</p>

<p>If you want to read an interesting subject,
turn to page <a href="#Page_131">131</a> and read the whole subject
and you will have it in truth; if you want the
best medicine in the world for colic, turn to
pages <a href="#Page_128">128</a> and <a href="#Page_129">129</a>. I will here state that the
Pipsisseway is the best for colic, it has a whitish
stripe running through the centre of the
leaf. The Wintergreen has not this whitish
stripe through the centre; both of them keep
green the year round. The Wintergreen is considered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
very excellent for colds and coughs, it
is used as a tea for coughs. If you want an eye
water that will relieve inflamed eyes, turn to
page <a href="#Page_194">194</a>; this is truly valuable and is a harmless
application, yet easily made, costing but
6¼ cents.</p>

<p>I have here named some of the leading articles,
which will prove to be very valuable to all
that have occasion to make use of them. Try
them and you will be convinced.</p>

<h3>SCARLET FEVER.</h3>

<p>I will here give to the reader the symptoms
of Scarlet Fever. This disease has slain its
thousands where the monster disease, Cholera
has slain its hundreds, and it becomes every
parent to feel it his duty to be careful when the
disease is in the neighborhood. It is evident
that the disease is contagious, in this form it
can be taken by inhaling the breath from one
that has it, and it is satisfactorily proven that
it can be carried in woollen goods from one family
to another.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Symptoms</span>:&mdash;This disease commences with chilliness,
dullness of the head and prostration of
strength, according to the violence of the attack.
There is sometimes nausea and vomiting, and
the surface soon becomes florid and hot.</p>

<p>The throat is generally inflamed and the
same appearance extends to the tongue, which
is sometimes of a very deep scarlet, tinged with
blue. If the symptoms are increased, it is called
Scarlet Fever in a malignant form, the symptoms
are very violent and the patient becomes
pale and faint, the heart palpitates, the Fever
continues to rise higher and higher, there is
great danger.</p>

<p>The pulse now rises to one hundred and fifteen
or twenty strokes in a minute. The pulse
and the eruption will give the form and character
of the disease. The eruption generally commences
with red patches, which spread and
unite till they cover the whole body. The
eruption appears first on the face and neck,
then on the legs, and the redness is greatest
about the loins and bending of the joints, and
on the hands and ends of the fingers. There is
however not a perfect regularity in the eruption<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
of Scarlet Fever, either in appearance or
duration. In ordinary cases the eruption remains
out about four days, when the grain of
the skin begins to peel off and in a few days
more it disappears. As the disease progresses,
the tonsils becomes specked with ash colored
spots and Ulceration follows. In favorable
cases their slugs come off in eight or ten days.</p>

<p>If the Patient does not die by the ninth day,
he will generally get well under proper management,
though it may be three weeks, in
some cases before he recovers. When this disease
terminates favorably, all the symptoms
generally yield, beginning about the fourth day
after the eruption appears. The patient is
more liable to relapse in this disease than any
other, and caution should be used to prevent
a relapse. Parents would do well to watch its
first appearance and keep their children from
its influence as much as possible using preventatives,
such as keeping a tar plaster around the
neck, keeping gum camphor, a little asafœtida
and a small piece of garlic around the neck&mdash;this
should be put into a small muslin bag and
hung around the neck. Let the children eat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
small pieces of garlic during the day. These
are considered preventatives by the Medical
Faculty.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Treatment</span>&mdash;Give mild purgatives, such as
Oil, to keep the bowels open. Drink plentifully
of balm tea, if this cannot be had, use Sage,
Hysop, Saffron Blossom, or Dittany. This
will bring out the eruption and keep it out full.
If this can be accomplished, the danger will be
very much lessened. This fact should be kept
in view in all eruptive diseases. Keep a Tar
Plaster around the neck; add to the tar a small
portion of Spirits of Turpentine, keep this on
for some time, renewing, adding turpentine
enough to cause the skin to red. If the patient
be not very careful when he gets out, he
will take cold, and the glands of the neck will
swell and suppurate and the ear will run, and
if great attention be not paid, deafness will
probably be the result.</p>

<p>They must be kept clean and Laudanum and
Sweet Oil put into them every day till they get
well.</p>

<h3>6 REASONS <span class="smcap">FOR</span> PLANTING <span class="smcap">AN</span> ORCHARD.</h3>

<p>First, would you leave an inheritance to your
children, plant an orchard. No other investment
of money and labor will in the long run
pay so well. Second, would you make home
pleasant, the abode of the social virtues, plant
an orchard. Nothing better promotes among
neighbors a feeling of kindness and good will,
than a treat of good fruit often repeated.</p>

<p>Third, Would you remove from your children
the strongest temptation to steal, plant an
orchard. If children cannot obtain fruit at
home, they are very apt to steal it, and when
they have learned to steal fruit, they are in a
fair way to steal horses, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Fourth, Would you cultivate a constant feeling
of thankfulness towards the Giver of all
good, plant an orchard. By having constantly
before you one of the greatest blessings given to
men, you must be hardened indeed if you are
not influenced by a spirit of humility and thankfulness.</p>

<p>Fifth, Would you have your children love
their home, respect their parents while living
and venerate their memory when dead, in all
their wanderings, look back upon the home of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
youth as a sacred spot, as oasis in the great
wilderness of the world, then plant an orchard.</p>

<p>Sixth, In short, if you wish to avail yourself
of the blessings of a bountiful Providence, which
are within your reach, you must plant an orchard.
And when you do it, see that you plant
good fruit, don’t plant Crab Apple Trees, nor
Wild Plums, nor Indian Peaches, the best are
the cheapest. Seriously, we have often wondered
why our farmers did not devote more attention
to the cultivation of fruit; it certainly
would prove profitable and pleasant. An orchard
of an acre or so of choice fruit, properly
taken care of could not be the least profitable
portion of a farm. Upwards of a hundred
bushels of fruit can be gathered annually, and
without much trouble from merely a small garden
patch. One great point to commence with
is to procure good sorts, for it requires no more
labor to attend a tree that will bear apples
worth seventy-five cents and a dollar a bushel
than one producing those not worth more than
two shillings. Let our farmers think of these
things. But, the inquiry is frequently made
how shall we manage our trees, to produce fine
flavored fruit in a short time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span></p>

<p>First, select good, rich soil, such as will produce
70 bush. indian corn per acre, if not such
it should be made such by manuring. You cannot
expect a tree to flourish and produce good
fruit when there is no strength or food to supply
it with proper nourishment. It is too much
like building a house without a foundation, or
sitting down to dine at an empty dish, there
being nothing to support the growth of the tree,
no food to supply it with proper nourishment,
finally, it dies for the want of nourishment, if
not, the fruit which it bears, if any, is small
and knotty, having scarcely any taste or flavor.
If you want nice, large, fine flavored fruit, prepare
your soil before planting your trees and
keep it prepared by manuring occasionally. It
is unreasonable to expect to raise fruit from a
tree when it is half or three quarters starved
out, all for the want of nourishment. You may
here make inquiry how to prepare your soil.
This may be done by putting a heavy dressing
of manure on it, then obtain sufficient depth of
soil, so as to enable the roots to extend themselves
freely and hold moisture without dying
out in protracted drought. This may be done
with a common plow, letting it run 8 or 10<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
inches deep, then by means of a good subsoil plow,
running it in the same furrow, you will obtain
a depth of 15 or 18 inches. This process should
be continued until you have all plowed that
depth. When you have this accomplished, run
your harrow over several times leveling and
pulverizing it finely. When you have all this
completed your soil will be prepared for planting
your trees. If you cannot possibly prepare
your soil in this way, you should by all means
dig very large holes, say six or eight feet in diameter
and a foot and a half deep, working the
manure through the soil as you dig it up. This
may seem to the farmer as requiring too much
labor, but will richly pay him for it in the
end. Plant your trees in this soil firmly,
leaving the soil a little lower about the body
of the tree, so as it may hold the water, if filled
up about the level of the soil, the water
will run away from the roots and your tree
may die for the want of moisture. Every
tree should have a stake driven in the ground
to fasten or stay the tree, so as to prevent the
storms from bending and switching it about.
If this is not done your trees will be injured,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
and will not thrive. There are a great many
farmers complaining that they cannot raise any
fruit. Truly, how can they expect to raise fruit
when they will crowd their trees into small
holes, and the soil so hard that you can scarcely
drive a stake into it with a sledge, and above
all the land starved out, the grass and weeds
suffered to grow up at such a rate that you are
not able to see the body of the tree. Young
trees should be nursed and cultivated, keeping
the soil mellow by repeated stirring and preventing
the growth of any vegetable for several
feet from the tree. A hoed crop is next best to
clear mellow ground. A sowed crop, grass or
weeds is ruinous to young trees. After you
have your trees well set, you should by all
means wash them down once or twice a year
with soap and water. Say about one quart of
soap to two quarts of water&mdash;wash from the
large branches to the bottom&mdash;this will destroy
the insects that may be put into the body and
limbs of the tree. Many drooping trees have
been made healthy by using this wash. If you
wish to preserve your peach trees, it is necessary
for you to apply this to them twice a year,
also frequently pouring reasonably hot soap<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
suds to the body and root of the tree; this will
kill and destroy the worm which so frequently
destroys your trees. The lie which is left at
the bottom of the kettle from boiling hot soap
is very good and should always be used to wash
your trees. If you wish to preserve your peach
trees, you should by all means search the roots
and body of the tree, and where you find any
gum caused by the worm, remove it by means
of a knife, carefully cutting away where any
gum is found, and as far as there seems to be
a hollow under the bark, then wash the whole
stem well, suffering it to run to the roots: It is
stated by a worthy gentleman, that by planting
tansey around the tree, the worm will not
trouble the roots. This is simple enough and
worthy of a trial. It is hoped that these important
truths will cause the Farmer and others
to put them in practice, and it most undoubtedly
will be the means of raising improved fruit
and will be richly paid for all his labour.</p>

<h3>PREFACE.</h3>

<p>The beneficence of an all wise Providence in
organizing man, so as to secure him dominion
over animals of inferior physical construction,
impose on him obligations to exercise that eminent
advantage in a spirit of mercy and in mitigation
of the pains and disorder of the brute
creation! Impose upon him as a gentleman,
as an intelligent Farmer, or as a man of humanity;
should deem it essential to make himself familiar
with the nature and injuries of the suffering
brute. To say nothing of the duty, which
common intelligence and humanity enjoins upon
every one to prepare himself with proper information,
remedies and common medicines, which
will enable him to extend immediate relief to
the speechless, suffering animals. No man
should hesitate, to provide himself with a book
which will teach him plainly in what way to
give relief to the poor speechless brute.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3_supp" id="Page_3_supp">[3]</a></span></p>

<h3>THE AGE.</h3>

<p>The age of neat cattle is very difficult to get
at, until they reach the age of three years; after
this, we get at the age by the horns. The
surface of the horn continues very smooth, until
the expiration of the second year of the animals
life, when a wrinkle or circle of thicker
horn begins to be formed around the base. This
is truly completed in twelve months and another
ring then begins to appear, so that if the
perfect rings or circles are counted, and two added
to them, the age of the beast is supposed
to be ascertained. These rings, however, are
not always clear and distinct, and it is very
easy to remove one or two of them with a rasp,
at least to the unpracticed eye, when the animal
begins to be remarkably old. In addition
to this, a well known fact should be stated:&mdash;That
if a heifer takes the bull at about two
years old, the first ring is formed a twelve
month before its usual time, and consequently
she would always appear to be reckoning by
her horns, a twelve month older than she really<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4_supp" id="Page_4_supp">[4]</a></span>
is. After all, the age as denoted by the horn can
only be calculated in the Cow. These rings do
not begin to appear in the Ox or Bull until the
animal is five years old, and then they are frequently
too confused to be accurately counted.</p>

<p>When in health, a softness of the skin, and a
glossy appearance of the hair, not only indicates
present health, but a disposition to thrive; while
a hard dry skin clinging to the ribs, and a staring
in every direction, show that there is something
wrong in the constitution, and that it will
be labor in vain to attempt to fatten such a
beast, for your own interest, you should put
your beast in good condition, and keep it in condition.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<h3>ON THE DISEASES OF HORNED CATTLE.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Inflammation</span>:&mdash;Inflammation is the most frequent
diseased condition to which neat Cattle
are subject. External inflammation is known by
the part being swollen, tender and hotter, than
in its natural state; in garget or downfall of the
udder, which is an inflammation of one or more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5_supp" id="Page_5_supp">[5]</a></span>
quarters of the bag; the affected parts are swollen,
tender and hot. If this state of the bag is
neglected, matter or pus will be formed, and
make a troublesome job, this should not be neglected
or deferred; if it is properly treated, the
swelling heat and tenderness will generally disappear.</p>

<h4>INTERNAL INFLAMMATION.</h4>

<p>Internal Inflammation by other and often more
indistinct symptoms. We can here seldom ascertain
the heat or tenderness, or swelling of the
part, and can usually only judge of the complaint,
by the effects which it produces on the
system. Every internal inflammation soon affects
the whole system, accompanied with considerable
fever, and that fever and degree of it is easily
ascertained by the heat of the breath, and the
mouth, and the base of the horn, by the redness
of the eye, hardness of the pulse and the loss of
appetite. When Inflammation seizes any important
organ, as the brain, lungs, bowels, kidneys,
udder, &amp;c., bleeding is to be immediately had recourse
to, after bleeding, a purging drink is to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6_supp" id="Page_6_supp">[6]</a></span>
be administered, sometimes it is necessary to insert
a seton in the dew lap. For external inflammation
from severe bruises, wounds and
other accidents, fomentations with warm or cold
water. Poultices made of Linseed Oil, when
they can be applied.</p>

<h4>BLEEDING, ITS UTILITY.</h4>

<p>Bleeding is a most useful and powerful remedy,
in the cure of Inflammatory Complaints. It
lessens the quantity of blood in the vessels, and
diminishes nervous power. The following are the
chief diseases, in which bleeding is required.</p>

<p>In all kinds of fever, itching and humors of
the skin, enlarged glands, or kernels between
the jaws, bruises, strains, catarrh or colds, &amp;c.</p>

<p>The jugular or neck vein, is that which is
mostly opened; in many inflammatory complaints
too much can hardly be taken, provided the bleeding
be stopped as soon as the patient appears
likely to faint or fall down. A strong healthy
Beast will bear the loss of five-six quarts of
blood without the least injury; large Cattle will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7_supp" id="Page_7_supp">[7]</a></span>
bear seven or eight quarts with decided advantage.</p>

<h4>ON PHYSIC.</h4>

<p>The chief purgative Medicines for neat Cattle
are Glauber Salts, Epsom Salts, Barbadoes aloes,
Linseed Oil and Sulphur. In some extreme
cases the Croton Nut, freshly prepared may be
used with decided advantage. Aloes are getting
into disuse, on account of it nauseating and exciting
the Animal; if it does not operate immediately,
half an ounce of aloes may be added to the
salts with decided advantage. In particular
diseases where there is considerable fever, or the
attack of fever is apprehended, there is no purgative
so beneficial as the Epsom Salts; in bad
cases twenty four ounces may be given at a dose,
and eight ounces of sulphur every six hours,
until the purgative effect is produced. Linseed
Oil is a good purgative, the dose is from a pint
to a pint and a half. Common Salt is a very
good purgative in mild cases, a pound dissolved
in warm water is a dose; it should not be given
when the animal labors with fever.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8_supp" id="Page_8_supp">[8]</a></span></p>

<h4>ON SETONING.</h4>

<p>The utility of setoning is to create excitement
and unload the overloaded vessels in neighboring
inflamed parts. The mode of inserting a seton,
it is commonly made of horse hair platted together,
cord or tape alone or leather, it should
be tolerable thick and ten or twelve inches in
length. Before inserting the seton it should
be dipped or saturated with Turpentine, tincture
of Cantharides, or Helebore. The seton now
prepared; an assistant is to hold the animal,
while the seton needle with the cord affixed to
it is plunged into the upper edge of the brisket
or dew lap, and brought out again towards its
lower edge. The space between the two openings
should be from four to eight inches; the seton
is to be secured by fastening a small piece of
wood, or tying a large knot at either end of the
cord; matter will begin to run the second day,
and after that the cord should be drawn backwards
and forwards two or three times a day,
in order to irritate the parts, by this means increase
the discharge. Where a considerable effect<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9_supp" id="Page_9_supp">[9]</a></span>
is intended to be produced, the black helebore
is the best, this will very quickly cause
considerable swelling, as well as a discharge.</p>

<h4>COLDS AND COUGHS.</h4>

<p>Colds or Coughs are frequently much neglected,
and very much injures the animal, let this
hint suffice, as soon as you perceive the animal
to have the cough, give a purging drink. Take
epsom salts 1 lb., powdered caraway seeds ½ oz.,
dissolve in a quart of warm gruel. After that
use the cough and fever drink until relieved
twice a day.</p>

<p>Cough and fever medicine.&mdash;Take emetic tartar
1 oz., powdered digitalis ½ drachm, saltpetre
3 drachms, mix and give in a quart of gruel;
house the beast and keep it comfortable, especially
at night, do not expose to cold and wet
weather.</p>

<p>If the above should not give relief: Take
emetic tartar half drachm, nitre two drachms,
powdered gentian root one drachm, powdered
chamomile flowers one drachm and powder ginger<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10_supp" id="Page_10_supp">[10]</a></span>
half drachm. Pour upon them a pint of
boiling ale, and give the infusion, when nearly
cold; give until relieved. Should not this entirely
relieve&mdash;take liquorice root 2 oz; bruise
and boil in a quart of water, until the fluid is
reduced to a pint, then add two drachms powdered
squills, honey 2 ounces; add to the above
and give as directed in the above.</p>

<h4>INFLAMMATION OF THE LUNGS.</h4>

<p>Inflammation of the Lungs is caused by perspiration,
sudden and great changes of the
weather, especially when accompanied with wet
and damp air at night, and particularly when
driving a long journey.</p>

<p>Symptoms are dullness, shivering cough,
particularly soar, the ear, roots of the horns
and legs are generally cold; the breath and
mouth is hot, the mouth generally open, and
there is a ropy discharge from it; the beast will
often lie down and can scarcely be induced to
move, the flanks heave, the head is protruded,
showing great difficulty in breathing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11_supp" id="Page_11_supp">[11]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Remedy</span>:&mdash;Copious bleeding is the first and
great important remedy; bleed until the beast
trembles, if you do not, you will lose your
beast; next, place in your seton in the dewlap,
fire the sides and blister, then follow with the
Fever medicine. Emetic tartar 1 drachm, digitalis
½ drachm, nitre ⅓ drachms; continue until
relieved twice a day.</p>

<h4>DERANGEMENT OF THE LUNGS.</h4>

<p>When the milch Cow is attacked, there is a
diminution of the milk, and it has a ropy appearance
and a saltish taste after being separated
from the cream. The animal has a heavy
appearance; the eyes being dull, with a stiffened
staggering gait; the appetite is impaired, the
nostrils and skin is of a yellow color, the bowels
are generally costive, by pressing on the edge of
the short ribs on the right side, the animal will
shrink, indicating pain and tenderness. Remedy:&mdash;If
any fever bleed, then follow with one
or two drachms of calomel, 1 scruple of Opium,
2 drachms of ginger, give in gruel a few hours<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12_supp" id="Page_12_supp">[12]</a></span>
afterwards. Give 12 ounces epsom salt and
half pint Linseed oil; the calomel and opium
may be repeated twice a day, and the purgative
also, until the bowels are sufficiently operated
upon; the sides may also be blistered, and seton
may also be inserted. If the animal should be
left weak, use the following tonic drink:&mdash;Gentian
root powder ½ oz., ginger 1 drachm, epsom
salts 2 oz., mix the whole with a pint of warm
water gruel, and give it morning and night.</p>

<h4>INFLAMMATION OF THE BRAIN.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Causes</span>:&mdash;It proceeds most commonly from redundancy
of blood, or overflowing of the blood,
by means of hastening the fattening too rapidly,
or by turning in a rich pasture.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Symptoms</span>:&mdash;In the early period of it, the beast
is dull and stupid, he stands with his head protruding,
or pressed against something for support,
he refuses to eat, is unconscious of the surrounding
objects, now and then suddenly drops as if
he were shot, he starts up all at once, is fearless
of any surrounding object, his eyes will become<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13_supp" id="Page_13_supp">[13]</a></span>
red starting from their sockets, will stagger
about, falling and rising again and run against
everything in his way, he will stamp, tear up
the ground with its horns, run at every one
within its reach, bellowing until nature is quite
exhausted; trembling will then come over him,
he will grind his teeth and saliva will pour from
his mouth, every limb will be convulsed and he
will presently fall and die.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Remedy</span>:&mdash;The chief or only cure is bleeding,
let the blood flow rapidly until he falls from the
loss of blood. Setons should be placed on each
side of the poll, and blistered on the forehead,
then follow with heavy doses of physic, when
relieved feed cautiously for a few weeks.</p>

<h4>STAGGERS <span class="smcapuc">OR</span> SWIMMING in THE HEAD.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Cause</span>:&mdash;Starvation during the winter season,
and being admitted into too fertile a pasture in
the Spring, producing a redundancy of blood,
which gives rise to the disease.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Symptoms</span>:&mdash;Are heaviness, dullness, disposition
to sleep, resting his head upon any convenient<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14_supp" id="Page_14_supp">[14]</a></span>
place, reels and staggers when he attempts
to walk.</p>

<p>If this disease is not checked by bleeding, or
purging, or proper management, it may terminate
in inflammation of the brain or fever.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Remedy</span>:&mdash;This must be remedied by bleeding,
purging and giving the fever medicine&mdash;after
purging, give emetic tartar one drachm,
digitalis ½ drachm, nitre ¼ drachms twice a day
until relieved, feed cautiously.</p>

<h4>INFLAMMATION
OF THE BOWELS WITH COSTIVENESS.</h4>

<p>Inflammation of the bowels is by no means
an uncommon disease among neat cattle, very
often proves fatal. It is easily recognized by
the peculiar symptoms.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cause</span>:&mdash;This disease mostly arises from exposure
to cold, and especially when cattle go into
rivers or ponds, after being heated and fatigued,
chilling the blood. It is sometimes
produced by too much dry or stimulating food.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Symptoms</span>:&mdash;The animal is continually lying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15_supp" id="Page_15_supp">[15]</a></span>
down, getting up again, strikes at his belly
with his hind feet. The bowels obstinately
constipated; dungs in small quantities, hard,
covered with mucus at times, streaked with
blood&mdash;the urine is generally voided with difficulty
and heaving at the flanks, accompanied
with fever, becomes fearfully weak and staggers
as he walks, he leaves his company, hides himself
under hedges, &amp;c. Becomes deaf, he trembles
all over, his skin is hot, back and loins tender,
ears and horns hot, indicating the highest
degree of general fever.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Remedy</span>:&mdash;The first thing to be done and that
which admits of no delay, is to bleed profusely.
Next, purge freely; continue the purging medicines
until the bowels are freely opened, then lessen
the doses so as to keep the bowels open. In
severe cases you must give injections until the
medicines operate freely. This is a very dangerous
disease and the course pursued must be
decisive, or the beast is lost! The only hope
you have after bleeding, is in physicing; you
should by all means clyster largely and in great
quantities, the epsom salts and castor oil will
do no harm; thin gruel is very good! Let these
hints suffice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16_supp" id="Page_16_supp">[16]</a></span></p>

<h4>DIARRHEA OR PURGING.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Diarrhea or Purging</span>:&mdash;In the first place indicates
some disordered state of the bowels, or
the presence of some offending matter in them,
and he will endeavor to remedy this; not by
attempting to arrest the discharge too speedily!
First, give a mild physic, then follow with the
astringent.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Remedy</span>:&mdash;Take a strong decoction, white oak
bark 3 ounces, laudanum 1½ oz., golden tincture
1 oz. Give it in thin gruel until relieved.</p>

<p>Dysentery, Slimy Flux, or scouring rot is
treated the same way. The symptoms of this
are considerable tenderness on the spine a little
beyond the shoulders, the dewlap hangs down,
and has a flabby appearance; the dung runs off
with a putrid and offensive smell, and as it falls
upon the ground, rises up in bubbles, the hair
appears pen feathered or starring; the eyes are
generally inflamed, with heaving of the flanks,
painful twitching of the belly, severe straining,
griping, &amp;c. This disease treated the same as
Diarrhea.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17_supp" id="Page_17_supp">[17]</a></span></p>

<h4>RED WATER.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Red Water</span>:&mdash;This disease consists of a discharge
of high colored urine, occasionally tinged
with a bloody appearance, it is an affection of
the kidneys; in some cases the discharge changes
to a dark red, or blackish color. When the
kidneys are effected, the beast evinces tenderness
on pressing the loins.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Remedy</span>:&mdash;Take oil of juniper ½ oz., laudanum
1 oz., oil turpentine 1 oz., mix and give in a
pint linseed tea, once or twice a day until relieved.
The oil of juniper may be increased or
diminished as the case may require it.</p>

<h4>GARGET, DOWNFALL IN THE UDDER,
OR INFLAMED BAG.</h4>

<p>This is a disease of the utmost consequence to
the owners of Cattle; young Cows in high condition
are most liable to it, especially at the time
of calving. This disease makes its appearance
in one or more quarters of the bag, which becomes
swollen, hard, hotter than usual and painful
when pressed. The milk is lessened and
mingled with blood, pus and corruption, at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18_supp" id="Page_18_supp">[18]</a></span>
times the flow of milk is totally stopped and
sometimes the inflammation extends to the hip
joint, hock and foot lock.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Remedy</span>:&mdash;It will be necessary as soon as the
downfall is discovered, and especially in an aggravated
case, to bring the animal out of the
pasture and if deemed necessary, take from three
to five quarts of blood according to the size or
strength, next give her a purging drink and
bathe the udder well with elder ointment, or use
mercurial garget ointment, which is made by
taking soft Soap 1 lb., Mercurial Ointment 2
ounces, camphor rubbed down with a little spirits
of wine 1 ounce, rub them well together.
Should there be any fever, give a few doses of
fever medicine; this is a disease of great importance,
as many Cows are ruined or lost purely
from neglect. The milk must be taken from
the Cow perfectly clean, and this should be done
several times during the day; and the Cow must
be fed scantily and with no stimulating food.</p>

<p>The teats sometimes get very sore, this is easily
remedied by using the ointment for sore teats.
Take elder ointment 6 ounces, Bees wax 2
ounces, Sugar of lead 1 ounce, Alum 1 ounce in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19_supp" id="Page_19_supp">[19]</a></span>
fine powder, mix them well together, whilst
cooling bathe the teats freely.</p>

<h4>TREATMENT OF THE COW, BEFORE
AND DURING CALVING.</h4>

<p>It is an old and true saying, and the truth of
it is nowhere more evident than in treatment of
the Milch Cow; that the prevention of an evil
is better than the cure. The Cow should be
dried six or eight weeks before calving, for two
reasons: First, the strength and constitution
of the Cow require a little respite. Second, the
mixture of the old milk and the new secretions,
that nature prepares for the expected calf. During
the early period of gestation, the animal
may and should be tolerably well fed, for she
has to provide milk for the Dairy, and nourishment
for the fœtus. But when she is dried,
her food should be considerably diminished:&mdash;She
should not be too fat, or full of blood at the
time of calving, for that is the frequent cause of
difficult labor, garget fever and death.</p>

<p>There are few things in which the Farmer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20_supp" id="Page_20_supp">[20]</a></span>
errs, more than in this. There is also an error
in starving her before she calves, but, is much
more danger in bringing her into too high condition.
Some Cows are apt to slink their calves
before their time; this generally happens about
the middle of their pregnancy. She becomes
feverish of her food, wandering in search of
something which she seems to be longing for.
She should be immediately removed from the
other cows, bled and physiced; the best thing
to be done is to fatten her for the butcher, for
she will be very certain to do the same again.
When the ninth month is nearly expired, she
should be looked after; if in high condition, she
should be physiced, and if necessary, bled, and
if she is about to calve, she should be separated
from the other cows, or brought into the cow-house,
and suffered to remain quiet, and undisturbed.
But should she not be successful in
calving within a reasonable time, she should
have assistance.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Symptoms</span>:&mdash;Are uneasiness, slight lifting of
the tail, lying down and getting up. The still
earlier symptoms are enlargement of the udder,
and redness of the space between the shape and
the udder.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21_supp" id="Page_21_supp">[21]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Treatment</span>:&mdash;When the labor has actually
commenced, the membranes will more and more
protrude until they break, and the fluid by which
the calf was surrounded will escape. If her pains
are strong, she should not be meddled with for a
few hours. And if no portion of the Calf presents
itself, the hand well greased should be introduced,
in order to ascertain the situation, and
position of the calf. The natural position is with
the fore feet presenting, and the muzzel lying
upon the fore leg. If this is found to be the case
and it has advanced into the passage, sometime
longer should be allowed to see what nature will
do. However, as soon as you perceive the throes
to begin to weaken, if no progress has been
made, manual assistance must be rendered.</p>

<p>Here there are two objects to be accomplished;
the saving of the lives of both the mother and
the young one; all should be done gently.</p>

<h5>THE MODE OF ASSISTANCE.</h5>

<p>The hand should be well greased, then introduced,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22_supp" id="Page_22_supp">[22]</a></span>
and the fore-legs of the calf laid hold of
and drawn down, drawing gently at the moment
of the mother’s throes. Care should be
taken that the head is accompanying them. The
hand will sometimes be sufficient for this purpose.
If the head cannot be moved by the hand,
a cord must be procured with a slip knot at the
end, which is to be moved carefully into the passage,
and the mouth of the young animal being
opened, fastened round his lower jaw, the end
of this must be given to an assistant, who should
pull gently but firmly at the moment of the
throes, while the operator draws out the feet.</p>

<p>Should not this succeed, take two other cords
or rope, and fasten one around each leg&mdash;two
assistants should pull at the feet and another at
the head; while one ascertains the progress that
is made&mdash;too much force should not be used, as
the calf may yet be saved. Remember the natural
position of the calf, is the presenting of the
muzzel lying upon the fore-legs. The most
usual false position, is the presentation of the
head, while the feet of the calf are doubled down
under his belly. A cord must be passed as before,
around the lower jaw, which is then to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23_supp" id="Page_23_supp">[23]</a></span>
pushed back into the womb. The operator now
introduces his hand and feels the situation of
the feet, then fix a cord around each pastern, or
about the knee, and bring them into the passage.
The head is next to be brought forward
again by means of the cord; the cords being
now pulled steadily together, it will generally
be extracted. Should the calf be dead, and
much swollen, the head may then be opened by
means of a knife, so as to lessen the bulk.
When the feet present and the head is doubled
under the rim of the passage, the cords should
be placed round the feet, the hand passed into
the womb, and the cord looped round the lower
jaw. The calf pushed farther back into the
womb, the head brought into the passage and
the three ropes pulled together. The delivery
effected as quickly as may be without the exertion
of more force than is necessary.</p>

<p>The last false presentation is the breach&mdash;the
tail appearing at the mouth of the shape.
The hand is to be passed into the uterus, fasten
the cords around each hock. The calf is then
pushed as far back as possible into the womb,
and the hocks are after brought into the passage,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24_supp" id="Page_24_supp">[24]</a></span>
the head placed in the proper position,
and the ropes changed if necessary, and all
three cords drawn gently, until the calf is extracted;
considerable force is sometimes needed,
but should all be done gently, with an increase
of drawing, until the job is completed. By
studying these cases, the operator will be able
to accomplish his object. In all cases of false
presentations, although great force must sometimes
be used.</p>

<p>The uterus, or calf bed is sometimes protruded
and inverted. The case is not desperate.
The part must be cleansed from blood and dirt,
and supported by a sheet, then the operator beginning
at the very bottom of the womb, returning
gradually, and with great care, and
patience. The animal should be bled before
this is attempted, and the application of cold water
should be used for some time; this will contract
the womb, and render its return more easy.
A stick or couple should be passed through the
lips of the shape; in order to prevent its return,
and give the following medicines a few times:
Take laudanum 1 oz., sweet spirits of nitre 2 oz.,
give in a pint of warm gruel. The protrusion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25_supp" id="Page_25_supp">[25]</a></span>
or inversion of the gut, should be returned the
same as in the womb, and a few sticks placed
through the shape.</p>

<p>The Cow should in all cases be suffered to
lick or clean the calf, as nature has designed it.
The cow and calf will be much happier if suffered
to remain together for several hours, having
free access to each other. The mother should
not be exposed to severe weather, immediately
after calving. Should have a few warm mashes.</p>

<h4>THE MILK FEVER.</h4>

<p>This is a disease which is prevalent amongst
Cows in high condition.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Symptoms</span>:&mdash;Staggering gait, breathing irregular,
eyes full and glassy, the animal reels, is
unconscious, the head turned on one side, the
feeling partially lost, the legs sometimes become
paralyzed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Remedy</span>:&mdash;Take epsom salts 12 ounces, flour
sulphur 4 ounces, ginger ¼ oz., spirits of nitrous
ether 1 oz., dissolve in warm water&mdash;give one
half of this twice a day, until the bowels are
opened, continue until relieved.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26_supp" id="Page_26_supp">[26]</a></span></p>

<h4>DISEASES OF THE EYE.</h4>

<p>Diseases of the eye are generally inflammations,
and caused by a bruise or blow inflicted
carelessly.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Remedy</span>:&mdash;First bathe the eye well with cold
water several times, say some ten or fifteen minutes
at a time. Then use the following lotion.
Take 40 grains sulphate of zinc, dissolve in ½
pint soft warm water, and bathe the eyes until
completely relieved.</p>

<h4>THE HOOVE <span class="smcapuc">OR</span> BLOWEN <span class="smcapuc">FROM</span> PASTURE.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Causes</span>:&mdash;The cause of Cattle becoming bloated,
is from being turned into the pasture in the
spring of the year, whilst the pasture is young
and full of sap, the ox or cow eats greedily and
rapidly, so much so that the stomach is unable
to propel forward, the portions of food as it
is received, and becomes overloaded and clogged,
the food remaining in the stomach too long.
Then comes the great danger; what you can do
must be done at once, or not at all. The symptoms<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27_supp" id="Page_27_supp">[27]</a></span>
are plain enough, the beast swells to an
enormous extent, the breathing is very laborious,
and the beast is threatened with suffocation from
the pressure of the stomach on the lungs. The
animal is lost unless relief is soon obtained.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Remedy</span>:&mdash;Relief is sometimes obtained from
motion and running the beast moderately; sometimes
from placing tar, or a tar band into the
mouth; sometimes from taking salt and black
pepper and throwing it down the throat; some
persons have run a lancet, or pocket knife, into
the animal, at the spot passing through the skin,
and the wall of the belly, so as to enter the
paunch; this should be done midway between
the last rib and the haunch bone. Another excellent
remedy is ½ oz. Chloride of Lime, put into
a pint or quart of warm water, and put into the
stomach, these generally give immediate relief.
There are other remedies, which generally give
relief; such as Lime water&mdash;also 1½ ounces of
Hartshorn may be given, with 1½ pints of water,
or 1 ounce Sulphuric Ether in 1 pint of water.
The following is plain and simple, and gives relief
in almost every case. This has been used
extensively, and always given satisfaction.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28_supp" id="Page_28_supp">[28]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Receipt</span>:&mdash;Take two tablespoonsful Rappee
Snuff, 1 gill Vinegar, 1 gill Sweet Milk. Mix
well and give as a drench. This has been
thoroughly tried and relieved nineteen cases
out of twenty; it is simple and worthy of attention.
No time should be lost in this disease;
what you can do must be done at once, or not
at all.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Preventatives</span>:&mdash;Every Farmer should adopt
the rule, to feed his cattle the following:</p>

<p>Every morning, take 1 pint air slacked lime,
1 pint ground alum salt&mdash;mix well and feed
with offal. Every particle of the lime should
be slacked. Adopt this rule and you will have
little or no trouble with your cattle. Dose from
1 to 2 tablespoonsful every morning, in offal
before turning into pasture. Another preventative:&mdash;Take
ashes, air slacked lime, and ground
alum salt, equal portions, and feed every morning,
or if you have not the lime, the salt and
ashes will do well.</p>

<h4>CHOKING.</h4>

<p>Cattle are extremely liable to become choked
on turnips, roots, apples, potatoes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29_supp" id="Page_29_supp">[29]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Remedy</span>:&mdash;Give ½ pint of oil, which will lubricate
the passage, then run gag, or tube, or rod,
with a knob at the end, down the throat; this
should be done carefully, so as not to injure the
parts. Should you not give relief by this means,
find the position, or place where the apple, or
turnip has lodged. This may be done by pressing
carefully along down the throat; place a
block on the one side of the object, then strike
a right smart blow with a mallet, or billet of
wood, sufficient to crush the apple or object to
pieces, which will instantly be blown out, and the
animal relieved.</p>

<h4>POISONS.</h4>

<p>Little can be done in this, unless you have a
pump, so as to extract the poison from the
stomach, then follow with physics.</p>

<h4>EMBROCATION FOR BITE OF VIPER.</h4>

<p>Take hartshorn, spirits camphor, olive oil,
equal quantities&mdash;mix and rub the wound, and
neighboring parts well, morning and night.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30_supp" id="Page_30_supp">[30]</a></span></p>

<p>One pint whiskey, 1 ounce hartshorn, 1 oz.
spirits camphor, ½ pint warm water should be
given to the animal.</p>

<h4>WOUNDS.</h4>

<p>The first thing is to clean the wound from all
dirt and gravel. A good fomentation with
warm water will effect this. If the wound is
much lacerated, or punctured, we must bring
them neatly together. If any portions so torn
as to prevent its from doing this completely,
they should be removed with a knife, or sharp
scissors; then the edges brought together by
means of passing a needle and strong waxed
twine deeply through them, making two, three
or more stitches, half inch from each other.
Then apply the tincture of myrrh and aloes, and
bandage tolerably firm, not so much so as to
prevent the circulation. If there should be
proud flesh, the wound must be cleansed with a
strong solution of blue vitriol, and then dressed
with the tincture. All wounds should be first
well cleansed, before applying anything on
them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31_supp" id="Page_31_supp">[31]</a></span></p>

<h4>ANGLE BERRIES OR WARTS.</h4>

<p>These are little warty tumors, growing on various
parts of the skin, and sometimes on the
teats.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Remedy</span>:&mdash;The easiest and shortest way to remove
them, is to tie a piece of waxed silk firmly
around the base of each, and to tighten them
every day; by means of this, the tumor will drop
off, and will rarely grow again. To make it certain,
the parts should be touched with a hot iron
or lunar caustic; the warts should be well scarred,
and they will never appear again.</p>

<h4>THE FOUL IN THE FOOT.</h4>

<p>The first thing is to examine the wound carefully,
and see how far it extends under the hoof
or horn. The first step is to clean all the foul
or proud flesh, by means of a knife, then apply
lunar caustic, or muriatic acid, until the wound
becomes healthy and dry. In extreme cases
where there is swelling, apply a poultice night
and morning, then apply the caustic, and keep<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32_supp" id="Page_32_supp">[32]</a></span>
dry and from all danger of getting dirt and
gravel in. When the wound begins to look
healthy, apply the tincture of Aloes and Myrrh,
until perfectly relieved, and give a gentle purgative.</p>

<h4>TO DRY A COW OF HER MILK.</h4>

<p>The best time to dry cows is whilst feeding
dry feed. A good dose of physic and after it has
operated, follow with an astringent drink, will
generally settle the business. Six drachms of
alum dissolved in 1 pint water, is a dose. The
cow should be milked clean when the astringent
is given; feed on dry food for a few days.
Should the udder get very hard in a few days,
milk clean and give another astringent drink,
and the third may be given if necessary.</p>

<h4>THE MANGE.</h4>

<p>This is a troublesome disease among cattle,
at times the itching torments the beast wonderfully,
causing the cow to fall off in her milk,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33_supp" id="Page_33_supp">[33]</a></span>
and generally get thin in flesh, if suffered to
remain any length of time. The most effectual
application is an ointment, which, sulphur is
the principal ingredient.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mange Ointment</span>:&mdash;Take flour of sulphur 1
lb., strong mercurial ointment 2 ounces, common
turpentine ½ pint, lard 1½ lb. Melt the turpentine
and lard together well; stir in the sulphur
when it begins to cool&mdash;when cool, rub the
mercurial ointment on a marble slab, with the
other ingredients, mix these together. This
should be well rubbed in with the hand daily,
wherever there is mange. If in the winter, the
animal should not be exposed to severe cold.
Give a few doses of physic, with sulphur added
to it. Warbles gad fly or ose fly, is quite an
annoyance to the animal. The fly generally
alights on the back, deposits the egg under the
skin, causing a tumour to rise the size of an hazel
nut, some larger&mdash;it soon bursts, leaving a
hole on the top, for the grub or worm, which
now lives and feeds on the fatty matter.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Remedy</span>:&mdash;Squeeze out the worm or grub, by
pressing firmly, if this cannot be accomplished,
open it with a lancet or knife, and put in a few<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34_supp" id="Page_34_supp">[34]</a></span>
drops spirits turpentine, a few times which will
destroy the grub.</p>

<h4>RABIES OR HYDROPHOBIA.</h4>

<p>This is a dreadful Disease, produced by the
bite of a rabid or mad dog. The symptoms of
its approach are dullness, loss of appetite, the
eyes protruding and red; is continually voiding
urine or dunging, saliva drivels from his mouth:
presently weakness of the loins, and staggering
appear; sometimes they linger six or seven days,
and die. There is no cure.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Remedy</span>:&mdash;Destroy the animal as soon as possible.
Care should be taken that the saliva is
not received on a wound; any wound which it
has fallen on, should be immediately well burned
with lunar caustic. Should you see the rabid
dog bite your animal, and find the spot, immediately
burn the wound well with the lunar
caustic, there is a possibility of their escape.
The hair should be clipped off, and every scratch
carefully touched with the caustic.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35_supp" id="Page_35_supp">[35]</a></span></p>

<h4>FOR YOUNG CALVES.</h4>

<p>Should the mother’s milk not be sufficient
to operate upon the bowels, or not at all, give 1
or 2 ounces Epsom salts, according to the size:
dissolve in ½ pint gruel, add a little ginger, and
a few drops peppermint, or as you may give
Castor oil; if it should be an obstinate case, give
an injection or two of salts dissolved in water,
and a little castor oil, this will set all right.</p>

<h4>COW POWDERS.</h4>

<p>This is an excellent powder for general derangements
of the System. Such as falling off
of the milk, dullness, stupidness, staring of
the hair, &amp;c.</p>

<p>This powder is truly astonishing in its effects
on cattle, giving new life and vigor to the animal.
No owner of cattle should do without
this powder, and should adopt the rule to feed
all his cattle, some of the powder, once or twice
a year, and especially before commencing to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36_supp" id="Page_36_supp">[36]</a></span>
fatten them. This powder is equally as good
for Sheep. Take</p>

<ul>
<li>½ pound gentian root,</li>
<li>½ <span class="ditto1">“</span> flour of brimstone,</li>
<li>½ <span class="ditto1">“</span> fenugreek,</li>
<li>½ <span class="ditto1">“</span> rosin,</li>
<li>½ <span class="ditto1">“</span> copperas,</li>
<li>¼ <span class="ditto1">“</span> cream of tartar,</li>
<li>½ <span class="ditto1">“</span> epsom salts,</li>
<li>½ <span class="ditto1">“</span> juniper berries,</li>
<li>½ <span class="ditto1">“</span> spice berries,</li>
<li>¼ <span class="ditto1">“</span> salts nitre,</li>
<li>½ <span class="ditto1">“</span> ginger,</li>
<li>¼ <span class="ditto1">“</span> caraway seed,</li>
<li>¼ <span class="ditto1">“</span> aniseed,</li>
<li>2 oz. antimony,</li>
<li>2 oz. columbo,</li>
<li>1 oz. gum asafœtida,</li>
<li>2 oz. alum,</li>
</ul>

<p>Pulverize these articles fine and mix well,
and it is ready for use. Any of the above articles
can be had at any Drug Store.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Directions for Use</span>:&mdash;Dose for a full grown
animal, one tablespoonful once or twice a day,
as the case may require.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37_supp" id="Page_37_supp">[37]</a></span></p>

<p>This powder cannot be excelled, it is an excellent
medicine for all derangements of the system,
it is perfectly harmless, and should be fed
sometime in all chronic and lingering diseases,
or at least until entirely relieved, and the system
put in perfect health. No animal can thrive
unless in health. Therefore every farmer should
adopt the rule to feed all his stock, and especially
those which he wishes to fatten with some
of these powders; by so doing you will save feed
and time. In fattening, feed on offal.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Directions</span>:&mdash;For a full grown sheep, dose, 1
teaspoonful once or twice a day, as the necessity
of the case may require. Feed on offal.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact

    Chief Executive and Director
    gbnewby@pglaf.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
